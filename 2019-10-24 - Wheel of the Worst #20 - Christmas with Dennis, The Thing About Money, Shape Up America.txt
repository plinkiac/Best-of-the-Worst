so are you moving, Josh
cuz this here is a moving blanket
oh
I mean, are we packing something up here
oh it's the wheel of the worst
oh
it has tortured us for years
randomly selecting terrible videos that are painful to watch
leaving only the most disturbing nightmares and scarring the mind for life
many have tried to destroy it
but true evil never dies
it is only reborn
it's now time to spin the wheel of the worst
so Jay and rich have stacked the wheel of the worst with probably worsts
that's my guess
lots of worsts
so many terrible videos
but we don't know what they are no we
don't have to find out but usually we do
kind of see what's on the wheel first
and we talk about it but this is I have
no idea
should we spin it first or should that's
probably we're watching blue moving
blanket a blanket
anyways let's see what's under the
blankets on the wheel of misfortune oh
no oh no no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh
no oh no no oh god no oh is that a
rubber band on his crotch yes oh no oh
my god oh my god Christmas with Dennis
oh you know okay Josh tell us about our
first video okay starting with the thing
about money earn it save it
spend it share it aid Association for
Lutheran's Lutheran's don't have any
cash everybody knows that this girl got
a blossom hat mmm well I I don't want
these these these white teens telling me
about cash let's move on
uh-huh oh don't let aids catch you oh oh
well I suppose it's gonna be kind of
talking to it looks like it's aimed at
youth it's that's true talking to teens
about AIDS got like a wacky yeah kind of
design with the tears a 90 stare that's
true but nothing wrong with the little
information
sure unless it's bad information
yeah I don't want to think about this
anymore cuz kind of bumming me out let's
move on to Christmas with Dennis Dennis
he looks like is he oh oh I thought he
was an amputee Oh like you know what
like if someone doesn't have the lower
half of the body that's what I thought
it was yes sitting he's yeah he's got
his hands on his on his knees there in
front of ya in front of them I think
I thought Dennis had a really bad
Christmas one year oh but no he's got a
great Christmas this year look he's got
he's gotten the is that either your
keyboard or accordion under the under
the tree and the train said and and his
sweater and his bowtie and his his
ruffled ruffled hurts feeling some music
maybe some Christmas music probably some
Christmas music probably some Christmas
music I'm really excited we're going to
listen to some Christmas music although
maybe not us be Christmas time and he's
just like let's play some some polka
hits or something you know oh and it's
just straight into the beer barrel oh
yeah was it a tree behind them he segues
into the blues and there's nothing
nothing Christmasy about it well
Christmas gives me the blues and then at
the end he kills himself
I'm camera mm-hmm and this is the only
copy because his grieving widow gave it
to Goodwill he made a case and
everything they really went all out and
it's left me this tape I should oh my
god
allies in transition how to prepare for
a peaceful death
no God the following Christmas with
Dennis producer Margie Finch men
registered nurse couple a 2003 well I'm
glad I bought some whiskey
I was having just a fine week and then
all of a sudden here's all this disease
and death and exercise yay
exercise can beat arthritis mmm that
sounds like a lie easy to follow
exercises that help reduce arthritis
pain increase range of motion strengthen
muscles and joints increase energy and
reduce fatigue mmm elderly workout tapes
yeah always get me excited it's true and
I guess it's not technically lies is
exercise can beat arthritis not exercise
will beat arthritis I mean it can
certainly help these folks need to watch
this there will be transitioning very
soon
depending on when this video was made
they may have already maybe during the
video oh that's me just like that all
those old people jokes we will assume
it's what they tune in for Oh
Survival Guide for adults mm-hmm - it
really looks like like Arnold
Schwarzenegger Oh like when he's out on
Mars oh yeah I can kind of see that
otherwise I bolster come on yeah help my
teenager is driving me but teenagers all
crazy I didn't even see that Fonda
I know that that's really incredibly
badly designed huh
did you get your test results oh yeah I
couldn't read that font no it's it's
it's it's extremely badly done I think
that what do I think that it's Christian
is the word ministry is gonna be on the
back of this tape yes I'll take those
odds the Christian marriage enrichment
center cluster well I certainly hope we
don't land on that it'll be terrible but
will it be as terrible as the magic
video now my question is is this a video
about magic or is the video magic oh
because it is it is oddly titled the
magic meadow that's true well this when
we put this video in the player will it
come to life and will magic start
happening I don't think so
in my logic being you've seen the Muppet
movie I have yes is that movie a muppet
uh that's that's a fair point yeah it
could be about magically turning
yourself younger it could be or that's
his child or his younger brother or
maybe they swap personalities
what's next shape up America it's back
everybody oh the the elderly parents of
now elderly celebrities oh yeah Wow
energy and Maeve with Billy B and P or
DLT award-winning star children's video

welcome and happy holidays from my home
to yours during this wonderful season we
generally remember some of the
Christmases from days gone by but in our
hearts we're always home for the
holidays the sexy looks we don't need
him in the video we're whole lot of
dentists is making love to that organ
and he's letting us know it and it's not
Christmas appropriate pirates we're
living in a post Christmas with Dennis
worlds there's some things you'll always
remember where you were yeah when you
got the news through JFK being
assassinated 9/11 and Christmas with
Dennis oh my god that's so horrible I
didn't realize you were alive when
Kennedy was assassinated you're so old
I'm gonna spin the wheel now all right
all right
oh my back all right we're gonna talk
about the money
the thing about money what is the thing
about money hopefully the video will
tell us okay
earn it save it spend it share it but
you know that's why right here that's
what the thing about money is all about
we're gonna talk about the money feels
like you got that sure you do but really
I mean we spend a ton of money every
year did you know that yeah right kids
just that you and me spend 93 billion
bucks on CDs Walkmans
we're your friends yeah that's a lot of
lunch money so are you ready I can get
money wise I'm ready let's go for it
what the fuck
Oh mad and so cold it's crazy
it's very quiet right now Oh a
thunderstorm may break out at any moment
we're gonna power through because we're
professionals
right professionals that watch things
like Christmas with Dennis we are
professional entertainers much like
Dennis much like Dennis and much like
Jacqueline Stallone and we are
professional not entertained errors wow
that's pretty good that's that's yeah
that's good that's very apt well Jay why
are there four tapes out here because we
were concerned that one tape might suck
so we did an extra spin
and we really wanted to watch shape up America because it's been on the wheel before
but we had to sit through some shit
uh, it was a musical night
yes
it was a very musical episode
it was
unexpectedly at certain points
this obviously wasn't
planned it's the wheel it's random but
uh yeah all of these had a musical
component less so the shape of America
but definitely the first three this is
the prequel to midsummer I hope this
ends like midsummer I don't know these
people look like they have too much
agency but our first tape was Billy B
and PLT energy and me Josh although you
may want to peel off we got to read the
back of this and find out what the fuck the point of this video was
what the actual
plan for this video was now we didn't
even look at the back initially we would
have seen energy and me music and dance
video complete running time
approximately 75 minutes I think you're
gonna say 75 hours
hat's what it felt like
here's the fucking thing
they actually have each video broken out
by time on the back of this host 4 3 3 2
3 6 640 that was longer than 40 that
segment I gotta take an hour I have a
question though real quick
yeah when this tape was manufactured yes
was this the sticky velcro substance on
it I don't believe so I believe we did
this
yeah but wants to get to the we were put
it on the wheel mm-hmm added the sticky
substance and didn't see the 75-minute
runtime
yeah do you know what was a long video
Mike Shoji Tabuchi you know was a long
video was Christmas with Dennis
thanks so much I hate this musical tips
two in a row is torture I know well but
what okay my question is what does the
back of the box say the tape is supposed
to be
it's like five or six music videos and every music video looks fucking identical to the music video that came before and after it
they just shot in the same location
until fall happens
yes
there's a division of three and two the
first three videos are with the older
kids there's more complex dancing the
songs are terrible
then the last two it's become fall there
are less and younger kids and the songs
are terrible worse there's still a semi
feel between all of them though because
they're doing dances that look similar
enough and they're all wearing brightly
colored shirts and every single video
theme symbols in every single video what
everybody new location because they got
like five locations they're just going
back through
yeah every video needs to be its own thing
yeah
this is all the same shit
no
you fucker
no
fuck you and your blue polo
well I think a very important thing to mention is that it started off as, like, an edutainment kind of thing where he's singing lyrics about like like solar energy and in front photosynthesis
and he's talking about yeah the water
cycle but you can't understand what he's
saying so it's it's almost like that the
the dancing part is bad the music's bad
and you can't understand the educational
content here's the thing like and like a
well made children's video you would
have characters that would explain these
things
and then while the energy cycle is this
and this and that and even though that's
kind of boring the music would come in
just to reinforce that yeah but you
don't you don't teach the science with
just the lyrics so this doesn't do that
either
it just acknowledges that these things
exist
I'm getting no information yeah yeah
this isn't informative er but it's not
teaching you anything about him through
the lyrics that's true it's just a list
of facts yeah
but the bigger issue is you start the
video and you think it is okay this is
meant for children to teach them about
these things in a singing and dancing
kind of way but that's the first there's
like four or five songs and then the
next hour is showing you the dance moves
and so I guess that is the purpose of
the video now if you have all those
sections together you're ready to move
on
if you don't rewind but otherwise take
it from the top well no that is the
padding of the video because otherwise
the video only would have been ten
minutes long and they have to charge
full price for it well this this man is
despicable yes he is
a talentless hack and he's awful well we
have to point out we've seen him before
this isn't our first Billy be rodeo no
so talking about worm poop a might sound
rude but warp is important plant food oh
this guy sucks I miss Mary I miss Mary
my Apple - her worms I never thought I'd
miss them I mean I'll give him one one
credit here he did have a pretty good
rap solo
it wasn't embarrassing either it's like
if Ned Flanders were dancing whatever I
say he looked like Harry Anderson
periander she looked like Harry Anderson
in certain certain spots he looked like
Paul Reiser sometimes and then sometimes
he look like Bea Arthur because he got
he aged like a hundred years in between
so did the kids adult kids that was shot
after the fact they started his tiny
children more kids were disappearing
than Willy Wonka's factory all I know is
that during all that rehearsal footage
or all that teaching new dance footage
the cameraman his mind was elsewhere he
was only interested in one particular
dancer focusing on earth the camera is
focused yes yeah I don't know she's the
best dancer or there's something else
going on something going on all I know
is the cops need to watch this video
because they could find a lot of missing
children there's no there's no foul play
going on those children are just ashamed
to have been in the video they're
keeping a low profile okay they live out
there oh great they're glad they were
wearing sunglasses yeah no I thought
that you were gonna find Billie be out
there I'll just hang him from a tree
yeah just swinging this swing yeah oh
here comes the rain again that's Billy
Beane his spirit is telling us to shut
up and move on it's the water cycle Jay
it's the water cycle we learned all
about it
Hey
I don't know if I could do it guys it
depends on how much longer this video
goes played song a gun man
is he trying to create like a hit song
by like nailing it in your head I don't
know and this will get his band back
together from the sixties the guys are
gonna see this song it's gonna be on the
radio Chris
that's really
I'll accept this
like The Killers dead
it's a quiet for a moment and then they
walk up on the body of it and pops back
up through
at one point he was doing like this
popeye kind of thing
there was a dance move that's just an air guitar, too
yeah
yeah
no, it's not
he's doing the, um, the who thing
he's doing the
no
yeah, yeah
he wasn't doing that
he was just
it was a full full swing
he's not tough it looked like an air
guitar this is this is gonna be a
tongues festival moment my friend he's
doing the do the full windmill yeah he
was and then it moved into like a like
morva like it's just a rotational thing
but at first it was an air guitar Pete
Townsend like full-on like who swing and
then it moved on
it happened 75 times
how did you not see it
apparently, I missed every fucking time
there's no guitar anywhere in any of these musical numbers
is there for a brief moment oh that
guitar hits on the front there playing
oh that's right yeah he plays guitar in
it I need to he does it he does he does
play the guitar in the war mania video -
I believe this man has many talents he
plays guitar music and singing and
education is not any of them yes maybe
someday we'll learn what they are yes
one singular talent sucking oh here he
is he's very good at embarrassing
himself it really is let's move on
well I don't know about you guys but I'm
in the Christmas spirit already a couple
months away of a Dennis see he brought
it out of us
I'm in the Dennis spirit the Dennis
spirit yeah no his translucence like
half the time Christmas with Dennis rich
I don't even know if it matters okay
Christmas with Dennis is like a lounge
singer video from out of time
they're gonna say from outer space
lounge singer video from out of time and
outer space sure sure he he's at
somebody's house we don't know if it's
his there's a family tied up in the
corner that's not a frame this should
just be called Christmas night where
that on there the cover reminded me had
something you'd like to see in the like
the cursed images let's all cuz this
looks like he doesn't have legs yeah
this is whatever it looks like he has no
legs just poorly lit Polaroid he's the
love child of Liberace and Jerry Lewis
and waiter and he's got his bling and
he's he's got his his sequined jacket
he's got a sequin jacket he's got his
organ and he's got a shitload of fucking dissolves
oh yeah
yeah this video is amazing
um even though it while there is
that stretch the when you just like the
somber Christmas songs we all wanted to
go to so yeah with no beat
Jesus like this is just made for little
Supercuts yeah up him well anytime he
stares at the camera so much while he
plays it's trying to give the like yeah
he's doing like that hey but I don't
know with Christmas music comes across
as awkward well it was very interesting
because he's definitely talented as an
organist but he's completely out of his
time period he seems like he should be a
1560s
yeah well he probably the video was made
in the 80s he's in like his 40s
yeah he probably grew up with that kind
of loan stabilizing that kind of yeah
yeah it this doesn't it doesn't have
like a like a self-aware kind of kitschy
quality it's just that's just him I was
there's made an 88 and I think he he
plays to the older crowd
that meant that might he might be that's
your lightly aware that his his style is
hammy
maybe elderly people in 1988 were buying
this because it Metin reminded them
nobody was buying this this is the only
copy but he's not gonna possibly I don't
all it's a dated double dip it looks
dated to us because it's old from the
80s and it was looked dated in the 80s
because he looks like something straight
out of the 50s style okay yeah and his
voice his his personality the way he
speaks sounds he sounds like he's a
character in like a movie it's like he's
a Martin Short character yeah in the
song Frosty the Snowman the lyrics say
there must have been some magic in that
old silk ant they found it seems like he
genuinely enjoys doing this sort of
thing and being a performer and he
doesn't seem to be aware of the how bad
it is I'm gonna say if anything he's a
little too cocky because he when he's
playing he's just like look at me he's
very loose with the finger yeah if
that's that also remind me of Liberace
too like a very the glissando you like
the back-and-forth slides yeah all sorts
of just like greens just like in that
Germany not sticking closely to the
melody at all
Josh talked about Dennis's organ okay
how big how big was it it's it's it's
it's it's a good double keyboard you
know a proper uh you know entertainment
size organ he's got the drum machine in
the drum machine
tends to have a mind of its own and
there are like 5560 buttons on this
thing and the only press is about five
of them
yeah he's got all sorts of different
tones in there and every time he hits a
different tone it's just like oh yeah
hey I hit a bull look good I'm doing out
I I can understand that aspect it's a
performance yes he's putting on a show I
really feel like he taped this on this
Aziz day off from the mall where the
vanity comes in it's like the camera
always has to be on his hands there's a
lot of that look what I'm doing look at
how good I am with keyboard well and we
got the contrast when all of a sudden he
introduces his sister who was a very
skilled organist as well she's very
precise yeah exactly she's very precise
she's playing the song like you're
supposed to play the song not a lot of
showing this and you get that contrast
of just like he's just a grain but she
also looks like someone out of place out
of time he has the big hair and like the
dress like she it all comes across like
like someone's like good like a
nightmare like someone's dream and her
feet go all the way under the screen and
come around and down back into the frame
but they start playing the piano yeah
the extremely long double exposure of
her foot pedal action oh there was so
much of just that just that switcher on
the board just got stuck halfway through
I'm just like we don't know how that we
can't we can't get it I guess we not
wedged into the groove finally managed
to get it passed yeah and then I get
just get stuck again on the way back the
cover of this video should have been
Dennis and like a trench coat and it
should have been titled double exposure
with Dennis double exposure with Dennis
well speaking of his sister it was a
pleasant surprise when she showed up
because we were looking at the opening
credits which were amazing - right let's
let our cast of characters weed we've
got frosty comma J do them in order in
order of appearance as they were in the
credits what is the order of appearance
Ralph Ralph Ralph Rudolph the red-nose
reindeer fly fly as ghosts yeah we get
anywhere any use to route up the
red-nosed reindeer who is just a spirit
that the camera happened to catch you
should submit this to Ghost Adventures I
know
then we get a sister well they it says
her name what's her name Deborah Deborah
Diane Diane no with a wife but but it's
her name and she has a open we reddit so
it's her name and then she has the same
last name is Dennis and our first
thought was oh that's his mom it's not
gonna be his wife that's his mom so this
plus is a surprise when it's like okay
it's not his wife it's a sister but it's
still not his mom so at least there's
that I have a special holiday treat for
you I'd like to introduce you to my
sister sister I know
that is a it's a special appearance by I
think if it doesn't it should because it
is a very special highlighted video yeah
because we see in the back of the studio
house there is a Santa Claus a doll that
is gyrating looks like it's humming the
air because it should have a list of
naughty and I assume it's supposed to
have something in his hands probably and
not probably looking up and down but
there's nothing in the hand so it really
is just kind of a thrusting his his
action is is is to look at the list will
turn head left look back at the list but
they had removed it your have the lists
and it just looks like he's humping
thrusting thrusting forward is a
difference and after we enjoyed Santa
Claus thrusting his way through the
video at the very end all of a sudden
there's a crazy video effect and Santa
Claus appears in the chair and goes he's
gonna walk up behind Dennis and then
turns back into the humping Santa Claus
that quickly it took a lot of energy to
transform into Humana first
all he had the energy to do after that
was wave and then say I gotta go back it
could have been Dennis it could have
been done we didn't see him without his
glasses on and see beard Dennis is too
much of a performer I can't see Dennis
just doing that's true yeah we saw him
as frosty and he PBB brought it yeah
wait wait oh oh you know that's not how
the magic works I had special special
white gloves that allowed him to play
the keyboard it's not the the big
probably pumping hands that came with
that cause boxing gloves yeah yeah yes
specialty gloves he really should have
like surgical gloves on like latex
gloves really that's what he had off
camera when he was dealing with the
family whose house he took over oh
that's the thing is he he went into this
house all those Christmas decorations
those are his he had to bring those all
in oh that's right and then when he was
done with his crimes he had to move him
out again take it all down this is a
legend of course so this is something
you put on in your living room during
Christmas time I'm gonna or you never
put on ever it's like it's like it's
it's it's kind of made for like
Christmas like a family get-together you
know the first like chunk and that's
dinner time somber music comes on you
know they don't show Dennis he's not
like making sex faces at the camera
there's lots of awkward jump cuts during
that part like he had no cut uses his
hands and then it's a hard time not by
himself because you can't do during a
somber part that's true yeah I'll give
him I'll give him credit for being that
self-aware he's busy cut into stained
glass windows Bing Crosby right the Bing
Crosby ornaments sheet music he doesn't
cut to the thrusting Sante once during
the Jesus songs that's true Dennis could
be portrayed by Bill Murray no no
Benedict Cumberbatch oh well physically
yeah this is that that Benedict
Cumberbatch was made to play the build
with low life story of Dennis mr. Kummer
bets if you'd like to get in touch we
have some story ideas we want to
recreate the main shot of this and the
shot with him looking in the camera and
his wonderful segues between songs where
he just uh it's like Casey Kasem you
said during a little bit Casey hey
everybody this next song and then then
he goes right into it he gets that weird
accent of always Santa's reindeer
Rudolph is the most famous
Johnny marks wrote a fabulous song
called Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer in
1949 and Gene Autry recorded it and
every year since then it's been a big
hit so let's listen to Rudolph the
red-nosed reindeer that weird way of
speaking and that particularly and we're
gonna recreate this shot we just need
benedict cumberbatch it was like this
could be you right here the role of a
lifetime like a mine hunters recreation
yes of another person yeah yeah yeah
let's do it
are you saying we'd get Fincher to
direct all right hey like how this is
going we need to ensure to direct this
just this static shot that doesn't move
we need to direct him to direct Benedict
no he's gonna he's gonna figure out when
the fades happen oh can we give him like
an old like yes they would picture will
have a videotoaster
no David Fincher's such a perfectionist
you would want to recreate it after the
fact and you would make it down to like
the exact frame the exact time to match
the original video that's yeah yeah and
he's also into serial killer stuff so
this is made for him it could be Zodiac
he looks a little bit like zodiac a
little bit he's got the glasses do you
feel like zodiac could be an organ
player I can kind of feel it rich it
could be DB cooper he used his money to
buy an eye organ I'm amazed if you
cracked the case
Wow for all this time all right thanks
everybody good night
and until we meet again may God grant
you much good health and happiness bye
for now
speaking of DB cooper our next tape is
the thing about money you jump out of
planes for it everybody if you have to
and all US holes are gonna gush over
just because it took fucking place in wisconsin
no that's all we're gonna say
about it and then we're gonna move on
that's all you people need I know that
place yeah we see the Avalon theater
which that's when we realized that the
Avalon theater I'm gonna show the inside
on the inside are like that's our
theater yeah
cuz the companies from Appleton
but this is this is all
I'm with you on this one, rich
yeah
don't give a shit
this video sucks
there's there's only two takeaways from that video
two
two, yeah
it's not very informative
and it's very 90's
it's extremely 90's
it almost feels like a parody of the 90's
yeah yeah
the Dutch angles
the exaggerated like like wide-angle lenses
we were trying to come up with a name for that style
right
because I've seen it in so many places
like you were saying Beakman's world
bill nye
commercial surrealism
cuz it's always fake
it's always fake hip
I'm down with the kids
yeah
yeah
it always feels like phony and embarrassing and it doesn't feel very real
everything feels
artificial so I'm I'm gonna call it
commercial surrealism okay you know
maybe that's what drew Childress went
into this project in this realism aspect
and she gets to do a number okay let me
put it to you this way
these two are are really like the oh
they're overdoing it with with in order
for kids to learn they they have to be
stimulated in every other fucking area of
their brain like that's not necessarily
true it's like you just gotta have so
much music and energy and then the
content just gets buried
yeah they leave so hard on that they
don't have any information yeah the
information is there I bet you if you
had a lick of like literal transcript in
words of this there's information but
they bury it so far under all the crap
that you you can make heads or tails of it
do you mean like food and gas and such
they're so worried about being hip
they're not conveying information yeah
effective exactly so we got to keep
their attention by not telling them
anything that's that's the nutshell rich
right there and their parents are very
good at budgeting either because they
didn't even have the money to get the
heat in their car fix
yeah they're sitting in the car freezing
to death
dad just sat up outside of the mall the
cold yeah the kids go into the mall and
then they come dancing out of the mall
they have a fake shopping spree cuz
they're just looking at things they
could get if they were yeah I know why
don't you just give them coats and not
pretend it isn't winter yeah we can see
the breath well they're sitting in the
car in the freezing winter maybe they
live there in the car the debt that's
with their dad with all their divorce
yeah there does damage in the car that's
hard I get it and yeah Rachel Dratch
Rachel Dratch Swinton kicked the husband
on he lives in a freezing car but he
says to the kids he's like here's your
like it's not spending money he's like
give me gifts money whatever that means
maybe it's a Christmas gift because it's
obviously winter even though they're not
wearing appropriate clothing rich it's
in Wisconsin it doesn't necessarily have
to be around Christmastime it could be
right now yeah it could be like July and
it's that cold yeah well he says here's
your gift money and they go yeah they're
going on a shopping spree but they're
looking at all the things that get by
and then they come back in the car and
they're like here's $2 each from both of
us towards that big-screen TV yeah we
didn't spend all the money we could have
so what'd you get had to do oh yeah
what's this
this is $2 for each of us for the family
big-screen TV so they saved $2 out of
their gift money and they wanted to put
it towards a big a big screen TV which
they also don't need also how's dad
gonna fit that big screen TV in the car
mister maybe the the it's to keep them
warm screen TV a lot of people do I mean
it is nineties yeah yeah big big tube
right yeah and even the projection sound
like today's modern TVs no dad's just
down there in friendly RGB lights he has
a lot of like a VCR hooked up to it with
one of those like video fireplaces
mental power insult injury yeah Rachel
Dratch is looking at them it's parked
outside their house crying uh-huh she's
inside singing making dinner making her
budget for the week
fucking a
it's just
just paying bills yeah what's his
alimony money
we just, we just made a better video than they did, guys
yeah
yeah, we did
uh, this is shit
give these characters some dimension
yeah that one sucks
moving on
whoa I gotta go
I gotta go walk some dogs
oh
I'm so sorry I spent money on this video
shape of America starring a bunch of
elderly celebrities elderly parents
there's a lot of things going on this
video and none of it is coordination no
and there's a voice to warning of it
yeah you need to like be the guy who
writes the the pink watch Jackie
Stallone Sylvester Stallone's mother and
Frank song and and Frank Stallone for
good everyone forgets about Frank Stoll
Jackie stones more famous than Frank
Stallone
what about Jacqueline Stallone is there
another one uh Laurie Williams who's
Robin Williams mom hey don't miss out on
it it's terrific we've got a lot of fun
in store for you she's stuck I'm waiting
for the tennis ball to hit her and she
just told you to look Harry Hoffman
who's the father of Dustin Hoffman and
let's not forget it's La Salle Pacino
salva Chino leave that's a he's saying
let's go so we can get it over with
what I wanna get out of here look how
uncoordinated is that our he's strong he
might be drunk the star of the show the
real star of the show Jacqueline wants
to be the star she demands to be the
star well the exciting thing about the
video was was picking up on all the the
social cues of these characters there's
a lot of rebels in this video there's a
lot of people with a lot of different
drama going on Sal Pacino steals the
show by not giving a shit
yeah
all right
the other side
calf stretches
what's sal doing now
there's a lot of wonderful narratives
that's like we invented for this video
we didn't know think they're some of
them it's in the tape it's very clear
the two women in this are snipping at
each other pretty pretty obviously and
it all comes it all culminates in an
Laurie Williams segment where everyone
each of our characters yeah they get
their own segment to do to be in charge
there's a number of catty comments
before it's a combination yeah it begins
with Jackie when she's leaving and
Laurie is just defiantly not following
the directions she's doing whatever she
wants time to spin around and Laurie
Laurie what'd you say I am facing camera
I turn around they're all supposed to be
spinning around and she just refuses to
do it
she will not do it she won't turn we
should we should point out that these
two women are as far away from each
other as possible for most of the video
it starts off friendly enough because we
think it's it's gonna be a like an
elderly swinger his video oh yes they
just started dancing swingers party
starts off yeah this many you're gonna
get x-rated paid for by Warner Brothers
quality control when we check the first
ten minutes of the tape after this it
turns into hardcore fucking
oh, no
oh, no
yeah, it's like freestyle dancing
and they partner up which I always thought was weird
yeah
because they're obviously not each other's significant others
they either have them or they're dead
and so it's it's Sal Pacino and and Jacqueline
Stallone start there the pedestrian and
then the other two do and yeah and she's
one point Jacqueline Sloane says like
hey Laurie how's um how's it not Harry
Harry yeah how's Harry today I'm not
even looking over there bitch
generally in like that exchange is like
something like you see how Sal is
pulling his leg that was fanny
and then and then Laurie is like Harry's
doing it too and she says I'm not
concerned about see how cells pulling us
put into his fanny stretching is
I'm not worried about how are you
stretching is oh my god and then they
get into their actual like exercise
routines and it's just a disaster
nobody's doing this train wreck and on
top of that it's nothing but like a
marketing gimmick it's scary to show an
assortment of products it's a fake it's
a fake exercise video by are overpriced
cereal products the silver foxes count
on Mottola products as an important part
of their daily diet you should to order
your mat all silver pack today you get
34 meals an informative nutritional
lifestyle video tape and km all for only
99 95 buyer foot scrubber experience the
satisfaction and benefits of the foot
brush relieve tired feet combat
offensive foot odor improve circulation
and stimulate acupressure points sign up
for our bogus program thing that does
something we'll get discounts on hotel
just the one hotel minded the silver
foxes club yeah and and remember that
Rolly metal is ever only thing I like
cured you of your arthritis or something
like it was like it's like gimmicks that
you see on like infomercials at 3:00 in
the morning but I want to I'm want to
back up and I want to go back to the
exercises because once we get through
Jacky's you know kind of warm up flexing
things she's in charge first yes then we
take over with Harry and Harry's doing
do Anna tennis kind of thing
what about Jackie let's pay attention
what we're doing now
shut the fuck up ladies
is this an attention thing
maybe
like my child has done so much better than I have
that's definitely the case with Jackie Stallone
i want some of the spotlight
Jackie Stallone seems to be a little more of a prima donna than the rest of 'em
Jackie Stallone appears to be just an attention whore
yeah
I think Al Pac-, I think Sal Pacino is just trying to have fun
here's an important thing to keep in mind when
you first start exercising and you're
into it a couple of weeks you may start
feeling not as good as you thought you
were that's because you've used up the
mature oxygen carrying red blood cells
in your body it's a chemical process
don't worry about it it happens to
everyone just don't give up stick with
it you'll start to feel better remember
go at your own or you'll die kills your
blood
exercising destroys your red blood cells
well, that's fine
it's just temporary
work through it
no worries
keep going
if you're elderly and you're exercising and you feel like shit, keep exercising
i've never heard that before
so, are we saying she's the ringleader
yeah
who who went out of her way to get all these other celebrities, as parents, involved and they don't give a shit
it feels that way
which is why like half of the time Sal Pacino is just fucking whatever in the background
yeah, yeah
this, this came out during the the height of exercise tapes
and and someone thought this was a genius idea
these, the parents of celebrities
oh, everyone will buy this
and they don't need they spent almost no
effort on coordinating an actual like
legitimate exercise routine it's just
going to go like this everyone watching
me
yeah totally that's what it's doing half
of them don't know what they're doing
they don't even work here no but this is
really what we thought was gonna happen
is like you sell this tape on the name
recognition of these celebrities and
then here comes some young one thing
that actually exercises for a living
yeah and we like start everybody listen
we're gonna do buh buh buh buh Josh that
would take the spotlight away from
Jackie Stallone right this is the
lunatics running the asylum it is
because there's no coordination there's
so little coordination that a voice
appears on the amateur on the overdub
track to say hey it's okay if you're not
synced up with these guys they're not
either doing the exercise you're okay
yeah don't worry if you're not following
the exercises perfect just keep moving
in an elderly person homes like that's
what am I supposed to be following
different don't worry if your exercise
class is a shitshow like this can we
turn about Jacqueline's salons face and
her questions yeah that's a question
yeah because she has the droopy lip
that's Stallone has yeah but Stallone
has it from when he was being born
what's the story well when when he was
being born and when he was apparently
having trouble coming out of Jackie's
vagina
they used some forceps on his head and
apparently it did some nerve damage to
his face and that's why he has the
droopy lip is like it's nerve damage
from when he was an infant ma'am and
people told him you'll never be an actor
whatever like shut up right this Rob
that's the thing is that he made his own
movie he made his own ways they did
signature
yeah and he's the start of this day he's
like it's like an upside down elbow
that explains Oh took me a minute the
forceps explains why Sylvester Stallone
has the drooping lip and what this alone
does not yes and it does nothing to
explain why Jackie Stallone has the
droopy lip yeah because she's constantly
doing that throwing speculated I
speculated this is just speculation I
don't know with these people that she's
just doing it just to remind people that
she is the mother of the famous
Sylvester Stallone yeah big famous
Hollywood movie star I'm his mother look
at me because when I saw that that lip
movement I said oh she's even got the
same and I thought it was genetic
because I did not know yeah about the
birth problem yeah it gives you a
beautiful glow being fit isn't just
becoming stronger oh my god she's good
dance yeah just a lone lip drop so yeah
and but it also is possible and we don't
know this either that maybe she had like
a mild stroke and it's a coincidental
yes
that would be pretty fucking amazing
it could be any number of reasons why she has that droop
and whether it's
purposeful or not we don't know we were
just really confused by the whole thing
you don't know the crazy thing though we
can still ask her theoretically
theoretically we could still ask her
because Jacqueline Salam is still around
a little little did they know that she
would be the last surviving silver fox
presumably I haven't looked them all up
mr. Hoffman is no longer with us oh yeah
I was Ju I looked up he's he's got done
for and he was the youngest one here's
the thing I'm fairly I'm fairly sure
she's just surviving on hate alone she's
she's too spiteful to die yeah just
outlive all the other silver foxes
yeah
she definitely had to outlive laurie williams
oh, yeah
oh, yeah
because of that, that fucking dominant stunt Laurie Williams pulled on her during her segment
yeah
we do find that actually as we watched more of the video that there were any number of silver foxes
there was, uh, Patrick Swayze's mom was a Silver Fox
which is very distracting because her face looks exactly like Patrick Swayze's face
yes
it was the first deep fake
Farrah Fawcett's mom was it was a silver fox
and of course Richard Simmons, his mom was a silver fox
i thought you were just gonna say, richard simmons
they were smart enough to bring Richard Simmons into the follow up video
well, that's because this one probably didn't sell
because this, this video is just a confused mess
it's a disaster
people watched it, and it's just a bunch of elderly people like flailing around with no coordination
Harry, Harry Hoffman is confused
harry, how are you doing
Sal Pacino doesn't give a shit
he's drunk
laurie williams and Jackie Stallone are constantly trying to murder each other
do we think we need somebody who knows about Fitness instructing and a fitness instruction video
or just four angry drunk elderly people
let them flail around until the videos over
is that really a good decision
at the end of Laurie segment which is the cool down the whole time of which Laurie has been just kind of like looming over over Jackie the whole time
do what I say this
and then you stretch this and then you stretch this
reveling in it too yeah you can tell she
was reveling in it Laurie does not
participate in her own an instructional
coach is the only one that doesn't yeah
and it's like ab workout so and then
she's just like like glaring but
kneeling or leering over over jacqueline
salonist she's like oh god she goes to
touch jacqueline stone and jacqueline
stone like in just pure revulsion like
curls up they say yeah that's a stone
Ian yeah there's there's this moment
during Laurie Williams a segment where
she's going around like touching
everyone's belly oh yeah and then and
then this is wonderful moment when she
goes to touch jacqueline Stallone's
belly and just a pure revulsion she
curls up into a ball
don't touch it
god
look at that
she balled up
don't you fucking touch my stomach
like a pill bug, just like, ugh
she said don't fucking touch me in body language
she did I assume she
said it on the set - and they just muted
it out because there's a ton of time you
can see her like Jacqueline Sloane's and
lips moving doesn't remember anything
you can't hear it it's all cut out well
they're giving another reason to have an
instructor to is to fill dead air yes
and and an actual fitness instructor
will be like hey come on everybody let's
see a breathing right and you're doing
it's like dead silence and then they do
like ADR and like Oh everyday stretching
your muscles is good yeah yeah yeah
sometimes it's um sometimes it's a
voiceover guy yeah yeah sometimes it's
weirdly unexpected live where Harry is
just like how you doing Jackie this
takes practice don't worry if you're out
of step or if your club is going in the
wrong direction yeah so they I'm doing
fine okay great I think Sony is yelling
off-screen talk talk yes
and then that's dysentery oh just how
you doing jack maybe that's when they
all get out of sync with each other's
cuz they're distracted by people yelling
at them off camera because they're old
and confused
do they have today like like like dogs
do they have handlers cuz because you
see so now honoree too far out of frame
someone pushes them back in wave some
boos they're looking off camera to their
handlers where's the rub does it over
with the slate did they put peanut
butter and Harry Hoffman's mouth to make
him talk if I can do it so can you
he's like this exercise is is good for
the heart
I had a quintuple bypass surgery look
it's a short life makes the most of it
I'm played tennis my mouth was just
running then they dubbed him over with
Dustin Hoffman's voice oh he's a little
big man thing you want me to do my dance
lines okay
give him some peanut butter it's legit
weird it's weird what it is is a classic
home video yeah that area's the
quintessential cash grab yeah yeah yeah
scam to put it bluntly to put it bluntly
and many home videos as we've talked
about before particularly on the wheel
are just that the thing is these didn't
really feel like that these these I mean
this one obviously has some sort of plan
I don't know what Dennis wants to show
off again he's an entertainer yeah this
was made by Lutheran's and then there's
just a straight-up scam and it's the
best one it's the best one
anytime somebody headed up a psychic
network there's some there's some sleaze
going on oh yeah and that wasn't selfish
II know although I would have paid good
money for that do you tell me where the
rum is let's begin with curls
they'll help develop your wrist strength
and flexibility while conditioning your
practice today
oh no this is not a tight production you
know this is Harry's just doing what he
wants is a sloppy disaster so that's our
tapes
that's our lineup of the night the
question is which which human being is
the most embarrassing oh oh definitely
Billy B yeah yeah
which is which you were you were about
to lead into the best of the worst and I
think we know which is bus and which is
the worst and you may be shocked no no
no we can go through it formally then
yeah
yeah I'm gonna say for me best of the
worst the shape of America with the
embarassing elderly people Mike oh
that's the worst shape of America
no doubt about it if I were to pick one
to destroy you you'd really be I would
not the tape him in the park I don't
know where he's at he's oh yeah he
already offed himself so we're good you
know got to worry about how yeah he's
swinging from a tree and I do you know I
do need to give it to shape of America
but I want to give a little a little
asterisk to Christmas with Dennis it's
so sincere it is so guileless it is what
it is
there is nothing more or less that could
be Christmas with Dennis you can't be
mad at him no yeah so the man with no
legs gets runner yes it's it's an it's
an it's an odd problem Oh
having no work running having no legs
runner up sorry I stepped on your joke
oh no that is not problem you're right
you're sorry you there's a there's a
there's a filler problem what we what we
want out of a tape is for these things
to be dense and short yes Jennsen short
like Danny DeVito if you're making one
of these videos Wow
wait rich is making a very good I don't
mean dense as far as intelligence dense
in terms of man okay anyway you're being
filler and rich is a big dunce in short
which what to make your brilliant point
because I agree with you yeah we want
something dense and short and just pure
entertainment distilled but if you're
you're
making one of these videos you don't
want to say oh yeah I'm only selling 15
limits worth of content and there's
pressure on your making shit like this
to have filler like like Christmas would
Dennis is 20 minutes of pure
entertainment in an hour and a half long
package disagree so they'll shave of
America best the worst effort absolutely
yes III love those elderly weirdos but
Billy be unless there's any objections I
think we should definitely destroy it
no no I I want to drop something heavy
on it from a very high height yes
let's teach Billy be all about potential
and kinetic energy I don't get it well
rich I think it's about time we teach
Billy be a little lesson about potential
and kinetic energy that's right Mike so
today which and I have rigged up a 2,000
pound safe with some ropes we're gonna
pull it up into the air and then drop it
on the tape
this is the power of math, people
science
fuck yeah
come on
there we go
okay, okay
yeah, the higher the angle, the better it seems to go to up there
one
two
three
how's that, jay
is that enough
ow
my arthritis
all right, rich
are you ready to drop the safe
oh, fuck
I'm ready
you ready to teach Billy be all about kinetic energy
fuck Billy b
three
two
one
holy fuck
holy fuck
holy fuck
wait a minute
why did we put it on the wheel
maybe we shouldn't have done that
