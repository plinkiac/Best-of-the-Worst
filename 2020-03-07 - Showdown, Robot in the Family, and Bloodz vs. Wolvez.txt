hey you rich it's time for another best
to the worst you excited yeah me too
it's gonna be great gonna be great
mm-hmm really yeah I know it's been
great the the winter though right so
cold you and your hot takes
I thought the wall was a lot closer to
me than it was
who'd have thought we'd be terrible
caretakers okay let's bring her
you got it
I got it
spring okay Shay yeah
I think we lost a few more flexible, paint off the arm, though
you guys are doing such a good job preserving them on your, uh, on your moisture-resistant shell
that's the wall that leaks from the ceiling, right
yeah
we can do this it's a it's showdown
so shadow down that's right that's what
it's called shadow down two sides of the
street
one way to die directed by
that's right, motherfucker
Leo Fong in the hizzy
Leo Fong for anyone who
doesn't remember
he's uh he's low blow yeah his low blow
and the other one anyway Leo Fong has
not let us down yet there's a first time
for everything
Oh a small southwestern town suddenly
erupts into a war zone when a vicious
motorcycle gang storms in sanctuary is
not your ordinary town oh hi Ron ik named uh
the violent town is called sanctuary
that's it
that Leon Fung
he's a clever guy who
shit
oh, my god
oh, my god
Thomas sanctuary right its citizens
are all retired gangsters retired
gangsters yes who now want to live in
peace and forget their turbulent past
but Kincaid the gang leader decides it's an excellent haven for his lucrative fencing and drug trade
fencing, like
no, are you an idiot
install fences around houses
fucking moron
that would make more money
frustrating
frustrated, the local law enforcement agent known as the commander -- Richard Lynch -- calls on his old friend, James long
I wonder who plays James long
with, uh-oh he's gonna zone he's got a bazooka
- why does he have a bazooka saying
everybody has a bazooka it's brightness
from home oh okay didn't kill any of
them okay and they still have a trailer
full of bazookas I just blew up three
crates if only you just waited Leo
eventually they would you're about to do
it alright so that was a fun movie I'm
just going to assume that Leo Fong like
lazily kicks a bunch of people
throughout the whole movie it was great
we totally watched it already we did
that's how this show works we came back
here after we watched the first movie so
on best of the worst we watched a lot of
like you know cheap knockoffs of
whatever's popular at the time but right
now I am proud to present a truly truly
original idea we have max magician and
the legend of the Rings I it's just you
just take popular.i peas out of a hat
and you go okay a Harry Potter, uh, Lord of the Rings go
just fucking go
that's so great
he's not wearing glasses though I would
assume that's what makes him wholly
original Jack clearly see he's not
wearing glasses you're right three and a
half stars from science fiction
Chronicle says a fantasy epic in the
tradition of Harry Potter and Lord of
the Rings
so rich we've watched an action movie
presumably and offended and we know
exactly what the second film we watched
was yes so here's our third movie it's
it's my Bloods versus wolves what the
battle begin prepare for the ultimate
battle of evil when two rival
supernatural gangs wage war on the
streets of New York City
the Bloods are effluent vampires who
rule downtown controlling the estate
blood banks of course and financial
institutions so they they run the banks
yes that looks just like my loan officer
the wolves are the werewolves in case
you didn't know
oh they're werewolves who rule the night
in New York's uptown ghetto now it's a
battle to the death to determine who
will run the city in the day the night
and for all eternity
Onis oh he pulled out his chicken breast
oh that was fine she stayed in character
you did it was a salvageable take no
probably the only tank but that's fine
we don't we don't need to talk about the
movies we could just let's uh well let's
just talk about what she's the best of
the worst
max magician in the legend of the Rings
obviously I mean it came out the most
unscathed we didn't riff on it a whole
lot so well who's taking the reigns here
like introduce welcome to Beth Horace so
nobody said I gave I gave a moment I
well I hit the table that doesn't mean
anything and then I was some new rule
you've concocted I would have but I
understand my fate we watched two and
one quart three in one quarter movies
our first film was showdown written
directed and starring Leo Fong low blow
legendary Leo Fong's it's been featured
on the show multiple times fourth time
well is the fourth yeah this is the
forest that low blow kill point point
blood street blood street yeah that was
the one we couldn't remember the name of
even though blood Street he is also
playing the same character as low blow
right well given his naming convention I
just assumed he couldn't think of
another name that rhymed with Leo Fong
yeah yeah who's introducing the film Oh
Mike explain showdown why me why not
someone's got to do it
okay so showdown stars kind of stars Leo
Fong as James long and there's a town in
Nevada called sanctuary which is which
is a disgusting rundown town it's a hobo
village it's yeah it has like an Old
Main Street with like dirty buildings
and all the houses are like like falling
apart and trashy but it's a it's a town
where it's not incorporated in the
United States it's completely off the
grid its autonomous to any local or
federal authorities in fact the paper
sign outside of the town says no one
welcome
non-residents prohibited?
how the fuck does that work
you live your life
you make millions of dollars in the mob
you're a successful career criminal
and then you you go to retire a rusty shanty town with a population of 500
clean up your kitchen if it's gonna be on camera
ugh, this is horrible
what the hell
great great just great my life of crime
did not pay off shack is crumbling
around it man my sanity is dwindling
every day but this looks like the worst
place on earth to live maybe Syria but
Florida this is a second yeah yeah why
would the mob bosses spend their
millions of dollars on this why would
our villains of the movie choose to make
this their hangout well no the villains
in the movie the biker gang has chosen
to make this their hangout because
apparently the US government has no
reach in this town there's a biker gang
led by a guy named Kincaid who that's
good I got a nice job rich yeah who
looks like Carl from die hard the big
big tall German guy whose real name is
Verner Herzog
I look into the eyes of Leo Fogg and I
see nothing but darkness he leads a
biker gang and the biker gang in the
very beginning does a drug deal where
they have big, uh, 500 kilos of the top grade shit
they say something like that
half a million dollars worth
so what do we got Dawson and the pure good thing no corn
this movie is 50 kilos of pure shit
we never see them selling it they just
steal the money and the drugs yeah so
and so on the next scene when we see the
gang they're strapped for cash yes and
they're robbing like the local like a
convenience store and flower shop for
$11 Oh Oh
news alert news flash this Justin Mike
just remembered something it's this is
important this is a big deal we've often
mentioned the phrase oh yeah shoot the
rodeo and and and everybody's
remembering now the shoot the rodeo
comes from a film called the chipper
well the movies called blood check it
was the villain the killer is called the
chipper
and it's a slow budget movie where they
take their cameras on they film a real
live rodeo that's happening the rodeo
came into town when they were filming
the movie
yeah well the story if we want to get
technical about it the story is they
shot the movie realized it was too short
so they needed some more footage to pad
out the runtime there happened to be a
rodeo coming to town so they just filmed
a bunch of b-roll of the actual rodeo
just to pad out the runtime and so we've
adopted that phrase as being shoot the
rodeo when a movie is just filming stuff
to pad the runs oh look there's a big
rodeo it's part of our movie yeah we
have horses in a crowd and yeah yeah not
just a pad the runtime to give it some
production value in this film there is
literally a rodeo and they are literally
shooting the rodeo so we are amazed that
it actually happened
look at that man counting dollar bills
that is certainly right there at the
rodeo look at that dramatic accountant
bill action he's counting his money
remember he's got his money he's like
one totally in the ticket booth for them
again
yes he's he's counting those dollar
bills and he has he has $42 and Kincaid
and his gay biker gang robbed him for
$42 and they murder him and then they
hang out in the town for weeks they say
it's like 3-4 weeks
I think it's been at least seven weeks
yeah at something very important that I
think you've glossed over is this town
is full of nothing but very very old
people all the buildings are ready to
collapse oast of the run time of the
movie is made up of these bikers going
into an establishment and fucking with the owners and pushing over elderly people
this is America
yeah
and so low blow is then contacted by Archerd link
Richard Lynch who is the quote-unquote
sheriff of sanctuary the town with no
cops or law so he says low blow this
biker gang is coming to town help me
take care of it low blow comes to the
town and three weeks later nothing
happens he's just there he does nothing
the longest time it's it's the most
passive we've ever seen low blow
he lets so many old people get beat up
what you know we're talking about oh man
we got all your money stashed in that
trailer oh my god oh my lord
there's a lot of elderly abuse in this
film yeah not as funny as you would
expect though odd for a town full of
like former mafia hitmen you you think
they just start shooting the bikers
themselves yeah they're not they're a
scuzzy biker gang just shoot them and be
done with it
no one has any guns it's weird I do I
pull vocationally they pull guns on the
bad guys and then just don't shoot them
no no not just a former mafia hitman but
former mafia hitmen living in a town
with literally no laws you think they
get it have their secret mafia meeting
in the towns of let's kill all these mother fuckers
you seen all walking down
Main Street pulling out their guns you
get the twist halfway through that it's
the mob town and they themselves take
care of the problem that is what you
predicted and that is what did not have
I know because the movie sucked the
ironic part is that sanctuary Nevada is
filled with former criminals when it
really feels like it's like a town
filled with pacifists mmm because they
do nothing and then remember low-blow
comes in and he wounds the one guy with
the gun and there's Kincaid and they're
threatening the one girl with the
butcher knife on the neck and in the
flower shop and love was a Google I'll
get you later yeah I don't have all
night low blow we gotta watch from hexa
magician in the legend of the Ring
get move on I've had a long day I need
some rest we low blow gets a little
partner for some of a movie a young girl
whose father is a former mafia enforcer
well she's very upset because her father
gets exploded into another dimension
don't tell me the trucks gonna explode now because of this
fuck you
fuck you, movie
you're gonna do this
well, I guess I'll try starting it now
oh, my god
that was a spectacular explosion
did it disappear
well, it's a weird transition, cuz I thought his car was in front of his house
so but it was at the mechanic's
yeah so when it explodes it does this
like dissolve to his house and I thought
the car just vanished it's called the
quantum realm we're sending ant-man in
the final well can we talk about the
girl the daughter of the guy who gets
blown up in the truck yeah let's call
her Tammy Tammy okay we should give her
that's not her name the lady's name
we'll call her Tammy she goes to the bar
the local bar and then she almost gets
raped
where's James wrong low blow
isn't really he's not carrying his
weight this film look oh yes he got lost
that's right he's gonna dump behind it
looks like he's carrying a lot of weight
to me oh he was he was climbing up a
dirty hill or anything he's beating up
homeless to do with the gang how would
you like a shovel head he's thinking but
he rescues Tammy from being raped and
then she stays in his his trailer yes a
Winnebago
whatever just low blow own a trailer
slash Winnebago yeah cuz we never seen
him drive it into town no he drives his
little he has hogs like he has like a
Honda Accord or how did he get the
trailer and oh my god
he has a Toyota Corolla
so, does he drive two cars
did he rent the trailer
is, like, that their hotel in the town
just a trailer
that's all they got
a dirty trailer
cuz it's a fucking dump
did he drive the the Toyota Corolla into sanctuary
yeah
and then uber back to wherever he came from that what is Winnebago and
take his Winnebago back to perfection
Nevada perfect where the tremors are the
and then the tremor ate the truck that
was carrying the Winnebago so he had to
drive his first car yeah the tremor
eventually hit the Winnebago or I was I
the what the Winnebago the tremor ate
the Toyota Corolla at some point yeah
only low blow coulda Lord Kincaid out
into the desert so that a tremor could
have swallowed him up
we would have solved the whole problem
Ike you're going full yooper here and I
just gotta say I'm with it with it I
would bet all those Harley Davidsons out
on the desert made a whole bunch of
sounds you know and that would attract
all the trimmers to Harley Davidsons and
swallowed up all the biker gang and then
you know what no more tremor worries for
me yeah
low blow says I got a plan I got a plan
Richard Lynch yeah we had a call my
friend can't involve fire no Richard
oh thank god it involves ancient
dinosaurs that live in Nevada they're
really tough really stupid because what
she did today was crazy and then she
stays in his his trailer and it's a
Winnebago whatever and she's eating a
cereal eat breakfast and then he says I
never eat breakfast why does he have
cereal if he'd ever eats breakfast he'd
sit for dinner he might he might have
see really lazy you just have an answer
for everything
the Piccard showing this he likes making
rice krispie treats Oh whatever we do we
better do it fast stop this carnage
let's go
let's do something fast
please, do anything fast
it's been two months
we haven't done jack shit
it's been two months, and they've killed threes of old people
so we have sheriff and girl
and low blow and they're gonna take down
the biker gang who spent the last 90
minutes terrorizing old people so after
no build up they just go to the bad guys
warehouse and they shoot everybody
well they shoot off camera and then
later they get shots of other people
getting shots that are completely
disconnected
yes but they murder a lot of this biker
gang and everybody except for Kincaid
food gets away get away
yourself can't get here we're all these
ladies this is like a titty bar Kate
would rather be here than at the
shootout I mean sure right we would all
rather be here but but where is he and
white in the mood for some fun cowboy
this is a brothel hey business Kincaid
get new Watson he's coming in I'll be
here about two minutes I thought the
deal was going down in two days yeah
that's okay by me if it's okay with
clutch yeah but there's an actor in the
film who also goes down Junior he does
like how she would cut her some he
doesn't cuz he's like he just did six
lines of blow before the taking
maybe it's like mr. ed and they put
peanut butter in his mouth so he could
jump off his lines later
why are things still happening what
things are happening I wanna know why
things are still happening
we've had our we've had our you know our
major action shootout finale of the
movie the only thing the only thing
that's left for the movie to do is to
have Lia Fong confront Kincaid for the
final showdown right this time it's
personal
this time it's personal it's a final
showdown and then the plot starts yep
the last 15 minutes of the movie where
where Kincaid sets up this this giant
drug deal between new characters we
haven't seen before
someone who licks his lips constantly
and then and then some guy who looks a
little bit like a brother love without a
tan there's a shootout in a warehouse
the shootout happens Kincaid leaves so
Kincaid runs away and instead of running
after Kincaid Leo Fong runs to an old
bartender in a bar hey I've seen Kincaid
the tall guy just there phone just stop
chasing them yes he left where he was
then went to an unrelated bar to ask
where he is it's like the scenes are out
of then the lip lipping douche bro tells
Leo Fong where to find Kincaid which he
constantly even though Kincaid tried to
murder him yes that that led to the what
may be the longest consecutive rich
Evans laughter
he stopped looking for him
sicko asked where he was looking to be
told he what you're resting
you just shot everybody else I've had a
long day I need some rest
sar Dex film max magician and the legend
of the Rings rich Evans explain our
experience of watching max legend max
magician and the legend of the max
magicians why would you do this to me
do do I not suffer enough you thought
you guys read the whole back of the box
and everything and and we watched the
whole film
I would I would love to tell you about
max magician and the legend of the Rings
but unfortunately that tape was nothing
but a tracking mess of static and we
couldn't watch it yeah
so so instead I am I am forced to talk
to you about robot in the family
this has been one of the I don't even
know what out are not open words to my
feelings while watching this movie a
confusion daddy the fundament shark
confusion oh you like to play I do after
I get my lenses clean that will come
back and play with you it's short
circuited my brain like every five
seconds yeah robot in the family stars
Joe pantaloons who also produced jogo
pantaloons from the matrix yeah and a
baby's day out and he in the style of
Borat
he plays a foreign man is there any
reason his characters Turk absolutely
none from Turkey yeah he's from Turkey
his accent changes a bit throughout the
movie there's there's like three scenes
in a row where he sounds like Tommy was
so his heavy Italian accent comes
through yeah he sounds like Tommy Wiseau
exactly like my favorite John
rhys-davies oh hi John rhys-davies so
he's he's he owns an antique store and
he's also a whacky inventor who was put
his family heavily in debt but he is he
is I apparently spent the last the
family's money to build a toy life-sized
robot for kids that seeks out gold and
also has alarms to protect the family
when it's in danger
I your daddy you are loved very much
have an said to the nation greatest
crime of the darling
ladies and gentlemen I give to you
security and it's the robot it thinks
that he's his father because it keeps
calling him dead and it doesn't
understand anything that's going around
around the house yard is filled with
toys because they have 14 children and
then his neighbor John rhys-davies who
also owns an antique store right next
door right next door not to his house to
the antique show appearances he's
auntie's neighbor to his house and he
has also owns the antique store next to
Joey pantaloons antique store it's a
major coincidence that has never
explained in the movie maybe it's like a
like the new season of serve Your
Enthusiasm yes where it's like it's a
spite store right store lot say Larry
yeah yeah the guy has a coffee shop and
and Larry David is mad at him so he buys
the real estate right next door so he
can open up a spiked coffee shop okay
Joe that might make sense Jay but you're
assuming that something in this movie
might make sense yeah that that movie is
the antithesis of sense
he lies it it literally is that's a pull
quo right there I said it would cure
insanity it's the opposite it's in
utters if this movie stands an utter
spite of the concept of sense yeah we we
hope we tent we might we might oversell
movies that are on best the worst I have
never seen a movie that nonsensical got
you now intruder detected they did not
end that scene so they just
oh my god I think this was possible I
didn't think this level of incompetence
was possible
we're our brains were literally melting
and that abrasive I was ways of
nonsensical it's it's just a cacophony
of noise constant constant yelling this
the scenes make you feel like tight in
the chest oh wait
yeah put on you and then when the brief
moments of silence you can breathe it's
it's noise it's amazing oh oh I think I
will take this to the shop and sell it
as an entry type now for the pizza we
need flour I can that's right
what sort of the right cause rye bread
is confused
shoot the president I want you to zoom
in on my face sue in my face any of our
face just fast-forward the movie at like
100 speed and it's like I guarantee you
my expression during the whole film is
going to be amazing it's utter shock
it's like you're on a roller coaster
into your own grave I don't know how to
explain it like people say that like the
grave of reason
my concept of bad movies is entirely
changed after some robot in the family
like people say the room is bad Tommy
why do you watch this it's a Hasidic Jew
and a there's a lot of acidic juice New
York that's fine but and a Beastie Boy
oh that's is that is that that's joy
pants and disguise no joy pants isn't
the oxygen reaction this is just a guy
that has a fake beard on this is just
happening on the outside of the world
and oh a robot the family's gonna save
him what is that Ricky pop what's
happening I
Jesus powers danger I told him to stay
away from the solar car I think of
having it but a heart attack I think I
might be having a heart attack
oh my god robot the family is just yeah
it is it's like constant noise scenes
happen and then they stop and then more
someone starts yelling and then more
madness happens it feels like someone's
like dream blowing someone's dream that
you know like a dream makes no sense
they took that and made it in a movie
and it's like they're filming it and
they had like two or three cameras
rolling and everything's happening and
they're just like filming nonsense that
happens and then and then they go back
and they they overdub it and then I edit
it together there's like toy robots that
are overdubbing it also aren't
apparently watching the movie just cuz
everyone is shouting here's an example
we start off with you we have our wacky
robot that doesn't understand things and
then we find out about the ancient
artifact that has been stolen from the
Middle East that will prevent world
peace war continues to rage in the
Middle East as two religious factions
blame each other over the theft of the
sacred helmet is suing mine these two
things happen right next to each other
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's
close-ups of how the robot works with
which stakes are extremely high in this
movie because they don't find that that
that ancient helmet they'll never be
world peace in the Middle East it's just
not gonna happen
yeah and then Joe the the helmet is
hidden inside of a replica of a
full-size we don't even get there what
is he doing it's like it's like you're
trying to unpack that we haven't even
set up where that you're talking 45
minutes down the road we're talking
about the stakes right we're talking
about the stakes of the movie world
peace or or not world peace
so Joey Pam spends the whole movie
trying to get this statue that has the
helmet in it that'll help World Peace
but then at the end of the movie you
know but
the only parent he doesn't know that the
helmet is in there even though he's been
chasing it the whole Joey pan she
doesn't want the statue he does want the
statue he gets the statue he goes to the
auction to buy the stage she was sick I
had to buy that statue we thought it was
because he knew that the helmet was
inside but it's rarely he doesn't
remember he built the robot to find gold
and then when the robot says there is
gold in this statute that he doesn't
believe you already know the gold statue
why wouldn't you believe the robot what
he finds the gold but there's a golden
helmet but there's also a golden statue
that's not yes a big stash yes well
that's what I want to mention yes yeah
no in terms of like that's an unrelated
ancient priceless artifact that has been
stolen that's what I mean when you say
this is like a dream when he said this
is like a dream how it's like there's
ideas in your head and concepts that
kind of connect with number one
everybody fell in the sewer
they got covered with shit
you remember when the robot violently assaulted a
police officer do you remember when the
robot got an army of little toy robots
to believe that he was a god you
wouldn't it be my friend
you're on John rice-davies stabbed
around your room when the kids started
randomly electrocuting future remember
when two Hasidic Jews walk past a blind
person the robot never is not talking
yeah so he was directed by Paul Feig
just keep talking maybe it'll be funny
just talk who's the robot the robot was
played by four different people at least
one of them had to leave the production
because he was hospitalized but
according to IMDB one of them is John
Patrick Shanley the playwright and
screenwriter who wrote moonstruck and
Joe versus the volcano is that thank you
me correct
I refuse to be corrected to random well
in the credits it said John Shanley yeah
so it could be someone else who has the
same name and IMDb's whoever entered that information fucked it up
cuz I'm to be isn't always accurate that
would be weird though but I would like
to think that would be weird
yeah I think that would be weird is a
little weird it's David Mamet because
that's the thing David nabbit was one
that was hospitalized oh yeah I can't do
this
that big mouth based off of the back of
the box and the front of the box you're
thinking that this movie is going to be
about a robot and a family yeah
it is not no the robot and a family
there that's true the plot of this movie
is the dad of the family trying to solve
a crime that he has nothing to do with
dr. plans office orthopedic surgery and
fine are reproductions he's speaking
are you selling phone sex operator what
is this what is this it's subscribe
would you like an appointment yes we
have plenty of time no problem at all
this whole movie adlib is this a
doctor's office and the joke is everyone
is in casts why are people in the
waiting room already in casts I just
want something to fix a follow-up exam
trying to make sense
the doctor has a a helmet fetish yeah
and his receptionist has a foot fell for
the first stolen golden idol the the
receptionist specifically says that he
sets bones correctly like he is a bone
doctor that is not working in a hospice
and helmets and he's this part-time
sculptor that's the weirdest thing we
cut to his office and there's like a
little guy on a horse statue which i
think was also in the movie earlier do
you like I made it myself and and he
says do you like that I made it myself
and then the scene just continues well
no it's the thing that happened and then
he has a gigantic foot cast on why do
they put a cast on his foot at all and
then the receptionist is in the doctor's
office and she's like oh you've got a
cast on your foot and it looks like she
wants to start to do four things have
sex with his cast foot and this
children's film about a robot in the
family a plaster cast of his foot and
the receptionist is weird sexual as a
foot fetish of a cast foot fetish time
for a bubble bath yuck I have cereal in
my servos newspapers are food for the
mind cereal is food for the stomach
the robot looks like max headroom fucked a traffic light
looks like Max Headroom fucked the Tin Man
and he's wearing the colander helmet from, uh, ghostbusters
who, who fucked the guy who is pizza the hut's assistant
i was thinking of the electric guy from the running man
oh, yeah
a lot of, a lot of influence on the
stone no and you know the robot gets so
much build-up in the beginning of the
movie it starts with like a dream that
Joe Pantoliano is having then the robot
is built immediately needs like
unveiling it to the family talking about
all the neat things it does
like it can call 911 if you just scream at it
it's very impractical
yes, that's appropriate
it's pretty fucking frightening to a two-year-old did
anybody else think it was odd that the
evil thief neighbor overheard him
talking about the robot that senses gold
has no interest in stealing the robot
that can find gold that would be a plot
masala yeah John rhys-davies the plot
would be about him trying to steal the
robot sensing the gold sensing robot
from the family and this is after a
series of scenes with the robot bonding
with the family and so then they're like
oh no he stole our new friend and they
have to get him back like a like a
family film wouldn't do well the robot
had a hard time bonding with the family
because he just poured like flour on
their heads yeah he had a very hard time
cooking breakfast
damn kids don't try this at home don't
be my circuits of us where's the movie
we have the cash scene in them for some
reason he wants to buy the statute yeah
well honey that was after he tracked
Bono and Clyde to the dock why no one
Clyde right that's a whole nother little
he tracks on a lot different themes that
also steal things though they didn't
steal the mystic helmet well they
mentally they steal things for John
rhys-davies right do and they want to
steal the mystic helmet but they got the
wrong statue remember I showed they
showed up at Jim Lee's house but they
had the different statue
it happened in the movie I believe you
Hey lots of things happened in the movie
can you call him Salah not Gimli I know
him as Gimli he is Gimli son of Gloin
you can call him so I understand that
reference but he's I'm only calling him
sliders not because of the show cuz he
really likes something that man was not
meant to disturb death is always
surrounded it
but but you know what he's a good actor
any and I feel bad for him legitimately
he got paid sure wasn't much you gotta
wonder what the behind the scenes on
this movie was like yeah as far as like
drag shows maybe yeah he lost a bet he
was he was like gambling was him and it
was the writer of moonstruck they all
lost big their own baby
that's why Julian's got the associate
producers credit cuz he's like you guys
got a pay off your debt I be in this
weird movie I'm that's a really good
theory enjoy pants John rhys-davies and
what's John Patrick Shanley they're all
in like like somewhere some bar like the
Horseshoe Casino yeah they're just
laughing like I had this dream last
night about this so I'm a robot that
could detect gold
and this fucking plot that makes no sense
dream about ancient
helmet being stolen from the Middle East
I had a dream about a nurse with a cast
fetish whoever whoever what looses the
Los Angeles Raiders football game has to
make this movie it was so they all had
to make the movie well I think joy bands
came out on top
John Patrick Shanley had to be in the
costume he's gotten hospitalized he got
you he had the low end of the bat the
the point spread you know it was like oh
you got to be in the costume of the robot
weird is it that the robot
could detect gold doesn't make any sense
this is a gold digger that's weird
remember the theme song it was like a James Bond theme
yeah
gold, like Goldfinger
it was like gold digger
gold digger
and there was
yeah, there was a theme song
remember, because we thought they were saying the n-word
yeah
oh, that's right
yeah, there was a fucking theme songs about gold digger
it sounded like they were saying go n-word, yes
for a second, i thought you were talking about it showdown when they
start blatantly using part of the James
Bond theme oh yeah that happens though
they sing gold day we're knife I clicked
on user reviews in the first one just
says what
so then we watch bloods versus wolves so
this is you right this I guess this is
me go for a Jack here well you know
before we get to actually blood versus
well something more interesting to talk
about is our selection process is no
slight against blood versus wolves but
the ideal best of the worst show has a
has an insanity ramped up you know you
start with a lighter movie get a little
crazier and on a big crazy high note we
don't watch the movies beforehand so we
just don't know how bad a movie is going
to be if Bloods versus wolves was the
first movie of the night what what a
glorious night that would be blood
versus wolves showdown robot in the
family perfect ramped up bad worse robot
the family robot the family no this is
like when we did
Ryan's babe and then we had to follow it
up with demon warp and it's like right
and so see that goes to show you I I
just thought Ryan's babe was the last
movie that's all memorable Ryan's baby
yeah well it did everything else that
yeah this might isn't might as well just
be a spotlight episode for robot family
so we're very sorry Bloods versus wolves
but you were a little bit of a letdown
after robot in the family detail where
what he did
oh he's a vampire and they knew that
wait that was a werewolf they're
werewolves
no they're wolves they're wolves why do
wolves have vampire teeth he's got fangs
like a wolf but also vampires have fangs
there's that fully transformed yet that
doesn't amount of sins but it's also
extremely confusing I understand what is
going on in the movie and it's it's it's
Reach is not as far as its budget yeah
yeah it's a classic case of like you see
the movie and you're like I can see what
was probably in their head when they
came up with these ideas there's not a
ton to say about it unfortunately it's
not horrible
it's watchable the biggest takeaway is
the guy who plays the lead werewolf we
look at a boson week Berk he is too good
for this movie yeah he's trying he gives
it his all mm-hmm he's not gonna not in
a sarcastic way yeah like he nails a
weird and schlocky part well the idea is
that the the vampires are feuding with
the werewolf's and have for centuries
and so we have and there's like also
like a like a class thing going on or
like the vampires or higher class I look
at paper plate with the fancy hors
d'oeuvres on it okay
we have the scene where the head vampire
and the head werewolf meet up in a bar
they call it a golf club but it's not
it's a bar uh-huh and he's very
claustrophobic close-ups to avoid
showing that it's just a bar yesterday I
try to assimilate
eighty but yeah he gives us like
emotional scene about you know his
struggles and his background and then we
cut to the next scene and a guy takes a shit on the floor
that is the joke
cuz he's like wicked he's like you know
we can discussion well there's this
apartment rich Jack whose theory was it
that the film was produced by a real
estate that's the only other note were
anything about this movie every location
in this film is completely barring no
furniture in sight there's there's one
scene they give it an excuse like the
first meetup between all of the
werewolves and the vampires and the
thing the snooty vampires didn't want
fleas on the furniture so we had it all
removed and and then we see where the
were wolves hang out and it's an empty
room and then they go double studs cuz
they haven't put up the walls yet they
go to rob the bank and it said empty
wall oh the bank robbery scene is a
whole another story this is a bank which
they really filled in a bank
how do that I don't know jack how did
they get access to a bank they show the
outside of a bank and then this is
clearly the incentive jay-j they're
filming in a bank this is a bank robbery
they showed the outside okay and you can
tell the bank because it has white walls
I'm pretty impressed
thank you for robbing the bank teller
I'm surprised there you can see the
tellers counter and they're doing all
these extremely dramatic person really
clicking on the keyboard which means
it's a bank okay
I'm surprised they didn't have a little
cork board with the layout of the bank
the bathroom in the bank has a shower
there they're stretching the limitations
of their budget the vampires are
supposed to have luxurious estates with
a butler
but the most they could do was a 600
square foot one-bedroom apartment in
Manhattan and also which cost $5,000 a
week to run and also the werewolf's
lived in an apartment that was under
construction which had one fridge and a
cabinet and a stove and a bunch of metal
studs where they had yet to put in the
drywall and that was it that was their
filming location that's the best we can
make sense out of it is that somebody
involved with the production worked in
real estate and was able to get them
access into places they were trying to
sell that had no furniture in right and
then the plot which leads into the most
important location of all the vampire
guy the bald guy what is this he wants
to have peace with the werewolves and he
says we're vampires
we're affluent we have properties and
you werewolves sir yeah how about you
guys run this dance club Ryan I know
about the Hampton Inn we're gonna have
so many bar mitzvahs Evanier it makes
you wonder like in in reality where they
shot that how many the Hampton Inn how
many magical wedding memories that
people had in that location the same
location that this and fight scene
happens in the famous vampire V where
we'll fight scene in
plaque on the walls somewhere in New York
yeah
whoa
oh, fuck
oh, just move the camera
bar oh the way the music
was playing I thought it was gonna hurt
cut to like a got to be continued kind
of thing I didn't expect a great fight
scene at the Holiday Inn I just want the
person to come in and go yep the room
for everybody stops the camera zooms in
10 o'clock we lock up a quick note about
camerawork oh yeah
two important notes one they have a dolt
left and right are the two important
notes they have a three-foot dolly
we got a dolly oh they're gonna use that
dolly look I swept dolly in back we
didn't mean to hope you enjoyed the ride
and that dolly is apparently on a rubber
band cause it just keeps me well I
thought you're gonna say cameras are not
invisible neither are vampires
the dvx 100 by Panasonic not invisible
you can tell the difference between
vampires and the werewolves because they
just both have fangs the only difference
is that the werewolves can be out during
the day but the vampires are also out
during the day maybe say it's not the
scene where there's sunlight blaring in
the windows it's nighttime I know that
girls are immune to day for night
oh that's the blood down they go to the
blood bank and they have their
confrontation with the 16 year old
doctor do you think you'd think if he
knew about the fact that ancient
vampires stored blood vintage blood in
his blood bank which was one old
refrigerator in a strip mall shopping
mall like storefront with no drywall hey
guy like like 21-year old Indian kid in
a enough tactus code occasionally
vampires or werewolves may show up
looking for this blood don't take your
Glock out and try and shoot them he was
working he was thinking about his boss
to me that made the most he wanted that
promotion they made the most sense
because when you have something valuable
Alex Gramma's table
hey thanks the furniture table this is
another case though where you think of
like what they probably had in their
minds and I'm picturing like instead of
like this a blood bank fee like like
this huge like warehouse with like a
cryogenic tube yeah cuz it's supposed to
be like a private facility it's his
personal blood bank or like out like a
wine cellar look in place cuz they do
the next scene they drink the blood in
wine glass yes that's the whole thing is
that the werewolves break-in and they
was the secret door to it in the back of
the fancy night yeah yeah
but yeah the wear was break-in and they
just shove full cloves of garlic into
the the
Ziploc bags of blood nobody notices that
executed poorly put a fairly clever idea
it could have been a fun idea
yeah but then yeah so the next scene
they drink it and they all die okay I
see what you were trying to do and I
think that's a lot of Bloods versus
wolves it's like they were going for
something and they had zero budgets we
can all appreciate that but they they
were trying to say something of substance while also showing people shitting on the floor
showing them shitting on the floor
that's an important point, Jack
that they were trying to say something that's right
can you talk about that in detail Oh
african-american culture I'm going to
explain it all to you right now what
will they're going I think we're joking
during the discussion that this is right
for a Jordan Peele remake yes he's the
guy to do it
so best of the worst
oh come on here oh you go on which my
brain can't answer that you know but
rich can your heart
it's right
it's Schrodinger's robot in the family
it's both the best and the worst thing we've ever watched at the same time
I won't I won't know which it is until we open the box
I don't know, I don't know if that cat's alive or dead
and we can never open that
we should never open that box
yeah of course it's robot in
that everything has changed once there
everyone so you get a Ryan's babe you
get a dangerous men it's what they call
a watershed film yes the best of the
worst Watership yeah or 911 films have
exchanged after it robot on the family
my pick for best of the worst yeah
showdown bad Lia Phong bad bad low
budget and and I want to see this movie
like on blu-ray yeah some needs to
remaster this this is this one's the
apex library a picture syndrome it's
just it's just gonna show up on Disney
Plus we have to find out who owns the
right to some behind-the-scenes
featurettes would be great it's
interviews with the cast there he would
Joey pants was I in that well yeah like
talk to the guys in the robot costume
whoever went to the hospital talk to the
the doctors that work at the hospital
do you remember did he do you think he
showed up into the hot in the hospital
in the costume that would have been a
confusing night should we do something
terrible to show down I don't think any
of the movies are worthy of destruction
should we blow up magician max doesn't
work it doesn't work and it's a horrible
ripoff of two popular IPs
maybe more fuck-you magician max yeah
teach you a lesson
your movie might be okay, but fuck you anyway
fuck you for forcing us to watch what might be one of the most interesting weird movies we've ever seen
what
well, jay, it's now time to destroy a movie that's right Mike we're gonna make max magician disappear
and we're just gonna do it nice and simple this time
just just beat the hell out of it with a
sledgehammer mm-hmm that's right where
it's the sledgehammer
I thought you grabbed a sledgehammer no
no I think it's I think it's in the back
room there all right I'll go get it all
right
oh no what is it it can't be what is it
you want to see what
what oh no no no
are we still gonna destroy the tape
you
