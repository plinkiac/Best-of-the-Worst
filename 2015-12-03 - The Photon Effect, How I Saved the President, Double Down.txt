Mike: Oh, hey! It’s Max Landis! Writer of such films as Chronicle, American Ultra, and Victor Frankenstein!
Max: Hi Mike! I’m so excited to finally be here, in the film capital of the world: Milwaukee, Wisconsin
M: Well, we’re glad to have you here, Max! [Rich walks in]
Rich: Oh my god! You’re Max Landis! Your father directed Blues Brothers...2000!
MX: That’s right! And he directed the first one too!
R: [Turns to the camera with an astonished expression] THERE WAS A FIRST ONE?!? [Nobody speaks, Jay walks in, the others look over at him]
Jay: Oh no [Zooms in on Max] It’s Rich Evans [Background music stops] Didn’t you die when the Showbiz Pizza Bear gnawed your neck off?
R: I did
[In the previous episode]
R: Oh god (?) it’s really biting my neck! Agh! Oh god! OW! OW! [Screams]
[Cuts back to the current episode]
M: Ummm, well, everyone, what do you say we watch some terrifying movies?
MX: Yeah!
R: I’ve seen something terrifying….Hell. Because that’s where my soul went after I died
M: What?
R: Would you like to hear the story about how I escaped Satan’s embrace and returned to my mortal body? [Bounces excitedly]
MX: No
M: Not really
J: Nooo
R: No?
J: No
R:....No?
J: No!!
R: It’s exciting
MX: You should’ve fucking stayed in Hell, you piece of shit

[1:53] M: Well, Max, let’s watch some films! Now, today we’re gonna do a Battle of the Genres, and usually that means action, sci-fi or horror, but today we’re going to do...something a little different. Superhero film, a children’s film, and I think...a thriller? Or espionage? We’re not really sure. But our first film...is called The Photon Effect
*Movie #1 The Photon Effect*
MX: Incredibly, uh, the cover actually has...orange and teal on it, a lot of people who follow film looks and the evolution of--of the way films are looking now...that, around 2004, orange and teal became the dominant colors in everything because it makes skin tone look richer and makes sci-fi stuff look cooler, but, uh, they’ve taken orange and teal, and what appears to be happening here are two floating heads, uh, looking--one guy kinda looks like John Cena, and one guy kinda looks like...uhh, Clark Kent, kind of, and they’re looking sort of cross each other, and two smaller thems have appeared in floating balls, and this guy has the red ball, and, as you can tell, this guy has blue balls [Mike looks at the camera, slide whistle sound effect plays]

[3:10] MX: What’s wrong with your face?
Jack: He’s too hunky. His hunk is extruding from his face
MX: I want him to slowly put on the sunglasses (?)
R: The experiment went wrong, the hunk factor went too high
JK: Right? Look at that face, just chin and cheekbone
R: “He’s at 125% hunk!”

[3:37] M: “The Photon Effect! Not every...one wants the power to change things” [Makes confused expression] 
MX: I love that!
M: That’s a great...titling, “from director Dan Poole comes a new original superhero,” now, it says “Dan Poole...Independent filmmaker Dan Poole, known worldwide for his live action adaptations of comic book legends…” Now, I’ll pause there, if you don’t remember Dan Poole, around I think 99 he made a sort of famous Spider Man fan film called Curse of the Green Goblin…? Theeee Rise of the Green Goblin?--[Cuts]--The Goblin’s Last Stand. I--I think that what it was called, I just remembered that all on my own
MX: That was incredible, I could hear you thinking
M: I know, I just, it was in--in the deep recesses of my brain and I pulled it out. But it’s like a terrible shot-on-VHS film and--but the--the part that people liked about it was he was doing his own stunts, he--he tied ropes to really tall buildings and was, like, swinging and jumping on cars, and all that stuff
MX: Oh, he was really endangering himself for his art
M: He was really endangering himself for his art. An earlier fan film, and then I remember this, because, around the time Sam Raimi started making Spider Man, there was a bunch of speculation on whether or not he was gonna give Dan Poole a cameo in the film...not uh--not plays Peter Parker, of course, but just a little cameo and then they said “no….sorry,” and then they stepped on him and squashed him like a little bug
MX: That used to be, like, a thing, like, in the early 2000s, there were so many different, like, fan films and stuff, people were constant, like, when the real movies started to get made people were like, “they’re gonna give a cameo or a nod or a anything…” and never, not--like, not once did they ever do it
M: I think they actually took a dump on Dan Poole
MX: Yeah, I remembered that, it made Variety
M: Yeah
MX: It was incredible, they were like, “Dan Poole brought to Hollywood, they told him ‘we’re gonna give you cameo…’ and he was like ‘oh, cool!’ and they went ‘no, no, it’s a cameo BAG’”
M: Let’s continue reading the back of the box now. “Now he brings you his first original superhero. Meet Derek Powers, a tower climber uneasy with a secretive client.” [Silence]
MX: What!
M: I guess he...he climbs towers and he has a client

[6:03] J: This looks like the opening scene to a gay porno
JK: [Laughs] “Pole Climbers”
MX: Is it not?
J: [Laughs] Wouldn’t that be great, if after like an hour of the movie it just cuts to hardcore fucking?

[6:20] M: [Continues reading the synopsis] “When he and his cousin Jaaay…[Looks at the camera]...are affected by an experimental technology, Derek decides to shut them down. But he may have to go through his cousin to do it”
MX: [Takes the tape] I’m so excited
M: Dan Poole must’ve hit his head a couple times while swinging around on those ropes
MX: Look at the pose of this guy
M: Yeah, he’s runnin’...
MX: It looks like a exercise video
M: Alpha Dog Productions. Quality, quality

[6:48] R: (?)  your chin to hammer these bolts in

[7:00] Guy: [In a high-pitched voice] Knock it off! Knock it off!
MX: What if that was his new voice for the rest of the movie?

[7:21] [In the VHs room] 
MX: I’m sorry, I’m still not over this syntax of a guy having to--deciding to shut him and his own cousin down, but then he’ll have to go through his cousin to do it, that’s a really incredible grammatical fuck-up
M: It’s--it’s intentionally left, uh, vague, uhh, just so we were interested in the film, I guess, I don’t know [Tosses the tape over his shoulder] 

[8:03] MX: Our next film...is How I Saved the President *Movie #2 How I Saved the President* You can see it’s from the brand Feature Films for Families, so you know we’re getting into. It features a kid...who looks like very embarrassed and kind of nervous...on the cover, like he doesn’t wanna be there, maybe he’s holding in a fart. As well as cute animals awkwardly photoshopped behind him on what appears to be a pedestal in front of an American flag

[8:55] MX: Uh, it says, “Nine-year old Max Anderson has a big problem: He knows about an evil plot to kill the President, and no one believes him!”
M: Wait, there’s a Max and a Jay [Points to the camera] This is getting weird [Turns back to Max] Continue, I’m sorry [Max winks to the camera] I’m sure there’s going to be a Rich in Double Down [Chuckles]
MX: So--so…”Adults don’t usually believe in talking dogs…” [Makes confused expression]
M: Unless you’re the Son of Sam [Mugshot of David Berkowitz appears] 
MX: “Max is certain that the tip of the would-be assassin’s pet dog is a sure thing.” The dog ratted out his owner?--”as he and his human and animals friends set out to stop the sinister plan, his parents, the police, ais bodyguard discredit his suspicion…” Max has a bodyguard? “When the agent Clyde...that guy, finally begins to catch on, time is running out, but they must act quickly to save the President’s life. This story reminds us that doing the right thing isn’t always easy, and heroes come in all sizes approximately 74 minutes”

[10:00] [The guys notice a creepy mask in the background]
J: There’s a monster in this scene 
[Zooms in on Rich] R: What the fuck?!
MX: Oh God in Heaven (?)
R: That’s the last kid who tried to kill the President

[10:15] MX: On the back here you can see that there is a parent’s guide, and I think, in the discussion after the movie we should probably address the family discussions we’re suggested to have, on the back
M: Oh, absolutely, ‘cause we are all family
MX: Yup

[10:53] R: Beat him to death with the club!

[11:05] [A painting rips as it falls on a bad guy’s head]
R: Oh, they ruined that nice painting

[11:10] M: Now, our last film...brought to us by KFC...is Double Down *Movie #3 Double Down* S--apparently, i--is it starring Neil Breen? Neil--
MX: Yes. Both of of his films are starring Neil Breen
M: And he directs them?
MX: And he directs them, and writes them, and shoots them, and everything is just him
M: Okay
MX: It’s literally like watching someone’s dream. Fateful Findings is like watching someone have a--a bad dream

[12:05] M: [Turns the tape to the camera] Well, he’s very proud of his face. He gives us no infor--and he--he has a tiny Las Vegas sign stuck in his neck. But apparently he’s just...he’s just in l--in love with himself or something, I don’t know, is that him?
MX: Yeah
M: Or is that an actor?
MX: That’s him, that’s Neil Breen
M: Hmm so--
MX: Neil Breen is an actor
M: Alright…
MX: Read the...read the review
M: “Stunning desperation,” four stars [Chuckling] Well….
MX: “Stunning desperation”
M: “The winner--”
MX: I feel like--
M: “Dangerously controversial”
MX: I feel like that was a review I got on Tinder once [Mike chuckles] “Stunning desperation”

[13:24] M: “The controversial story of a lone genius who closes down the Las Vegas Strip”? I don’t know how, or why, but--”the government can’t stop him! And he reunites with his dead girlfriend each night.” That’s the synopsis
MX: All--all--both of the Neil Breen films I’m familiar with feature a overabundance of ideas, mainly centered around him having secret knowledge and being a genius. People constantly complimenting him for being a genius. It’s sort of like in The Room, where they’re like, “you’re such a good guy, Tommy” the whole movie. Or--”Johnny, you’re such a good guy,” except for, in this, he’s a genius

[14:24] M: Still trying to get that Directv

[15:01] MX: Can you run us through what’s happening on the back of...
M: Well…
MX: ‘Cause it looks like a lot
M: I--I--I can barely read the--the font
MX: Just so--I mean like...it’s black text overlaid on an image...uh, “an edgy action thriller set in Las Vegas during a terrorist attack. A genius computer loner takes control of the city and the attack as he fights with his fits of overwhelming depression and obsessions with love and death.” Are you scared? ‘Cause you should be! [Turns the tape around] Bang! It’s Neil Breen
M: Now, let’s make some predictions, do you think they film anywhere near the Las Vegas Strip? Or just show a picture of it?
MX: You know what, I think it’s gonna be in the movie
M: You think so?
MX: I think Neil Breen is crazy enough and doesn’t understand permits…
M: Okay
MX: And this probably isn’t any kind--there’s no kind of union involvement, there’s probably no kind of...production company involved, so I would be unsurprised if he just goes out there and steals shots
M: I’m gonna predict there is a shot of him walking down the strip and some guy holding the camera secretly and it’s like…[?] really terrible-looking and then the rest of it is stock footage or stuff he shot from a hotel room, I don’t know 
MX: I mean, we should be so lucky
M: We’ll see, we’ll see [Max throws the tape onto the shelf, it falls on the ground] Double Down just went down
MX: Dude, that’s why I--that’s why I wanted to meet you, man, ‘cause you’re…[Slaps the back of his hand on the other hand’s palm] funny
M: I--I didn’t find that funny

[20:44] R: He never robs the bank and kidnaps the mayor’s daughter, he just...he just blows shit up because he’s a jerk
M: He just wants to get back together with his ugly girlfriend

[22:10] J: Oh my god, it looks like The Amazing Bulk
(...)
Josh: The Kool-Aid man was here

[25:42] M: These people are in the hospital more than Charlie Sheen

[29:48] MX: Can we talk about how...the hunk, the hunk factor? [Brief silence]
R: You may talk about that if you wish

[32:32] M: Lady who got her purse snatched, who has the wardrobe done by Kohl’s…

[36:07] J: This movie isn’t even listed on Family Films’ website [Rich laughs] This movie doesn’t exist

[42:50] [Talking about the recommended family discussion questions on the back of the tape] 
R: You know what that is? That’s bullshit to try and make this worthless movie looks like it has some kind of moral value
J: Exactly, exactly
MX: It’s a framing device to make parents buy it and show it to their kids and be like, “this was a worthwhile choice,” when in reality…[Sticks finger in his mouth and makes retching noise]
J: Yeah
M: Like there’s some kind of lessons you can teach your kids from it by looking at the back of the box
MX: What kind of lessons...
R: I could do the same thing with, like, Taxi Driver
MX: Yeah, you can do the same thing with any movie
R: “Travis Bickle tried to shoot the senator. Was that wrong?”

[43:54] MX: “How did Max Landis die?” Well, he said too many stupid things in a row. He had a brain aneurysm in Wisconsin

[53:46] M: I have to say, after surviving 30 plus Best of the Worst shows…
J: Sure
M: It’s a rare occasion when Jack leans off his seat...and moves his head towards the screen, because, as we all know, Jack has a superpower. But with this, he was like [Leans forward]
J: “I want to understand it and I don’t”
M: “I need to--I need more information”
MX: There were moments where we were all physically drawn towards the screen
M: Uh--I fell off the chair. You--you were sitting on the floor, I was laying on the thing, we were getting closer to the screen, we needed more.

[55:16] R: It’s like Holden Caulfield wrote it after a traumatic brain injury

[56:20] R: It’s genius, though, by virtue of everything being wrong

[58:06] [After deciding to destroy How I Saved the President]
M: Fuck you, Victoria Jackson
J: Linda Shayne
M: Linda Shayne
J: You should be ashayned of yourself [Max holds his hand up for a high five] Okay, I guess
