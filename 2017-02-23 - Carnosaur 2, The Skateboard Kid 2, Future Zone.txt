Jay: Good morning, Jack!
Jack: Good morning, Jay--[Laughs] 
J: It’s, uh, it’s 10:30 in the morning and you’ve already been drinking for several hours?
JK: Hmm-mhmmm!
J: Uh, which means it’s time to shoot a Best of the Worst!
JK: I’m so excited!
J: Jack, did you hear that Kevin Smith wants to make a Jay and Silent Bob 2? [Jack sighs] He wants to make a sequel, did you hear about that?
JK: Kevin...Smith…
J: You don’t want to see a 50 year old Jay and Silent Bob making...fart jokes and smoking weed?
JK: Uh, no
J: I mean, coming off the heels of Y--Yoga Hosers--[Rotten Tomatoes score appears]--I’ve got the highest expectations for this Jay and Silent Bob...
JK: [Counts on his fingers] He’s had nothing but hits, we’ve got Cop Out, we got Tusk, we got Yoga Hosers…[Looks at his hand] j--eh--boom boom boom! Three strikes you’re in!
J: But anyways, doing a Jay and Silent Bob sequel, and speaking of sequels…
JK: We’re gonna watch sequels! To movies we’ve already watched on Best of the Worst
J: This is actually our second time doing this, so this is our sequel to our sequel episode
JK: [Raises the first tape] This is a sequel to a movie I saw, Carnosaur 2! [Carnosaur 2 title card appears] Uh, “C2 is what the film Jurassic Park should’ve been.” [Jay huffs out air] So we’re starting with blatant lies--[Jay laughs]--that’s great. Uh--Oh! It did win an award, it won a Golden Scroll Award from the Academy of Science Fiction and Horror
J: That’s--that’s Roger Corman’s awards ceremony
JK: You think? 
J: Yeah 
JK: “A crew of technicians is sent into a top secret mining facility to investigate a mysterious power shortage there. Deep inside the cavernous tunnels, they discover a horrifying evolution that has occurred in completely defiance of Mother Nature”
J: So does this have anything to do with the first Carnosaur or are there just more dinosaurs in it?
JK: It sounds like these dinosaurs complete…
J: This is unrelated to the dinosaurs from the first Carnosaur
JK: Right, right
J: Ok
JK: But there are just other carnos...why were they called Carnosaurs?
J: ‘Cause it’s a great title
JK: Right….[Looks at Jay confused (?)] “Dinosaurs have returned from extinction to wreak havoc upon mankind!”.....But it doesn’t say “again,” so apparently this is just a completely--
J: This is just an unrelated dinosaur movie
JK: I just want...I want this to appear in the movie [Points to a picture of a dinosaur with a woman in its mouth] 
J: That just looks like a display at like, some sort of, uh, museum
JK: [Laughs] That they dangled a model from?
J: They couldn't--they couldn't afford to get the carnosaur puppet back for the promotional stills so they just went down to the mu--local museum
JK: “Hey, can we dangle this, uh, bitty from your, uh, dinosaur mouth? [Jay laughs] Here’s 20 bucks”

[3:09] J: Well, Jack, our next film is The Skateboard Kid Part 2 [The Skateboard Kid 2 title card appears] Well, this looks like a different kid. I’m guessing he’s not even playing the same character
JK: Well--may--hopefully we get to see what happens with that talking skateboard, ‘cause like, wh--
J: Well, this looks like a normal skateboard
JK: Uhhh….
J: I do seem to recall there being a dog on the cover of the first one that was not in the film anywhere?
JK: So maybe we find out…
J: Maybe we’ll get a--some resolution to this dog. What are the odds there will not be a dog in this movie either? Uh, “when there’s magic in your heart, you can soar….” Asterick, uh, “don’t try these stunts at home” [Jack laughs] This is the, this is the “special family” version of the film, as opposed to the violent R-rated cut. “Take a roller coaster ride full of high octane adventure as 12 year old Sammy...takes to the skies! With the help of a fantastic flying skateboard, Sammy ends up the hottest skateboarder in town. A group of local thrashers don’t like the extra competition. They plot to destroy any chance of Sammy competing against them in a local tournament. But! They don't have a clue what they’re up against. Not since The Karate Kid or The Mighty Ducks has a family film inspired such exciting action!” And we also have Dee Wallace Stone, who played the mom in every 80s movie ever. Uh, she was--E.T. The mom in E.T. She was the mom in Cujo. She was the mom in Critters
JK: Ohh, yeah, yeah
J: And she was in, uh, Lords of Salem with Bruce Davison, so this is a Lords of Salem, Rob Zombie’s Lords of Salem reunion film
JK: [Laughs] That’s great
J: And they spelled Jim Wynorski’s name wrong on the credits

[5:02] Rich: Wow, the skateboard makes him grow a foot taller!

[5:19] J: Jack, what do you have?
JK: I have Future Zone!...First of all, Jay…[Looks at the covert] what is this a sequel to?
J: That’s a sequel to the film Future Force. Where David Carradine is drunk the whole movie and has a robot arm
JK: That’s...that sounds great [Picks up a can on the shelf and drinks, Future Zone title card appears] I--I actually did not see Future Force, is there anything I need to know about Future Force going into this?
J: David Carradine was drunk…
JK: Okay
J: And he has a robot arm
JK: Great
J: And that’s the movie
JK: Perfect
J: And it was directed by David Prior, as is this movie. A Best of the Worst legend at this point, David Prior. Uh, but this film stars Ted Prior as well, who was not in the first one
JK: [Points to a picture on the case] And here he is [Flips the tape over] “Hunted, hated, and destined to die. The future was his only way out!”
J: Ooh, so we get time travel?
JK: That’s grrreat!
J: I’m excited now, the first movie did not have time travel
JK: “John Tucker (David Carradine) was the fasted gun in the new world. Until he was slaughtered in a brutal, bloody battle! Now, thirty years later, someone is trying to stop that murder!” Time traveeelllll!
J: Okay
JK: “Armed with a time machine and a .44 magnum--[Jay laughs]--Tucker’s son--”
J: Okay
JK: “--Billy…”
J: Okay
JK: “(Ted Prior), blasts through time to change the course of history and save the father he never knew! Teleporting through the Future Zone, Billy arrives in Los Angeles one step ahead of destiny! And….” [Turns the back of the tape to camera, Jay laughs] We need to stop here, ‘cause we’re gonna have a little discussion about how to properly, like…
J: Format your text?
JK: So, like, like here, here’s the paragraph a--uh…”and six…” way up here now--
J: Okay
JK: That’s not how you do it
J: No
JK: I see, like, they wanted David Carradine front and center, but it’s like “and….” 
J: Yup
JK: “And six hours before Tucker’s predetermined death. Facing a barrage of gunfire and explosions, this father and son prove to be an unstoppable force as they battle all odds to clean up the town and save their li-i-i-ives”
J: If he has a time machine, why does he only go on back six hours before his dad dies?
JK: Um, ‘cause that’s really convenient for the movie?
J: [Laughs] ‘Cause that’s what happens in movies

[8:13] Son: [Yells] Where are you going?
David Carradine: I’m gonna get drunk!
[Camera zooms in on Rich as he bursts into laughter]
JH: I’d like to quote(?)…
J: That’s the truest moment ever captured on film with--
JH: No it’s not! Because it’s implying that he’s not already drunk
J: Ohhh, yeah yeah yeah [Jay laughs, then Rich]
JK: That was a very real moment
J: That was--yeah, yeah
JK: That was the only line delivery I’ve ever believed in this whole movie

[8:58] JH: I mean, like he’s--
J: He doesn't understand the property. Even though he’s been a part of it from the beginning
JK: And apparently he was a--he was against what turned out to be, honestly one of the best episodes of television I’ve seen in a long time
J: [Laughs] Yeah, one of the best moments in season 2, he was actively--
R: One of the best moments--
J:--trying to stop them from doing 
R: One of the best moments in all of Evil Dead
J: Oh yeah
JK: Yeah. It was this wonderful sequence, and apparently he was against it
JH: He completely, 100% yes?
J: He wanted to get it out of the show
JH: He doesn’t have any idea what he was doing
JK: Apparently not
JH: Oh my god. Alright, speaking of fucking things up, today we watched three sequels...

[9:57] JH: Jack, please...let us know what happened in Carnosaur 2
JK: Alright! Swinging--
R: I was actually hoping you would go with me because then I would’ve just started describing Aliens

[10:27] J: Wooaah, dino vision!
JH: That dinosaur’s seeing in a different aspect ratio

[13:53] J: But before that death, we go to the, uh, like, control room, which is clearly a reused set from another Roger Corman movie, because it looks like the Star Trek Enterprise
JH: Yeah, and it’s just that one chair, right in the middle
J: Why is that in a science base?
JK: Yeah
R: I would love to know what Roger Corman movie that was built for, though
J: That's true, we’d have to look up one of the 72 other movies he made that year--[Rich laughs]--narrow it down
JH: I’m sure they’ll tell us in the comments [Jay and Rich laugh] 
R: [To the camera] Fu--fun fact...if you scroll down just a little bit and you see the same thing you’re gonna say in the comments 10 times, you don’t have to say it again [Jay laughs] 
JH: It’s ok
R: “Is Carnivore 2 replacing Aliens?”

[15:05] J: Why--why didn’t they call this movie Carnosaurs, by the way? [Rich laughs]
JH: You know what? Too clever
J: [Chuckling] Too clever…
JH: You can’t--you ca--
J: They gotta make sure people know that this is a sequel to Carnosaur
JH: Rings…
J: “First you watch it, then you die”
[Silence]
JH: It’s true
JK: It’s true!
R: It might just take a little bit longer than you might think
JK: A long timeline
JH: First you watch it then you live 50 years then you die

[17:21] JK: They unwrapped the present for us. In Carnosaur they basically threw a gift certificate at us [Jay laughs]
JH: “Here’s 20 bucks to Starbucks!” From not (?) close too, just like--
J: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
R: The Coupon Shot!
[“The Coupon Shot™ This phrase is owned by Rich Evans and Red Letter Media LLC. All Rights Reserved” appears onscreen]

[18:29] [A carnosaur rips a woman’s arm off]
J: He disarmed her?

[19:58] JK: It’s li--it’s like in Star Wars Rogue One when Forest Riddi--Wir--Riddi--behm--
JH: Start over
JK: It’s like in Star Wars--
J: The Chronicles of Forest Riddicker?

[22:43] J: Is that the Mad TV guy? [At the table] Uh, uh, Michael McDonald from Mad TV is the helicopter pilot
JH: Why not, he’s the biggest star in this fucking movie
J: He is, I mean, at this time I know he did work for Roger Corman a bit here and there at the time, so it must’ve been just like, Roger Corman called him up and he’s like “Michael McDonald, we need somebody to play the helicopter pilot”
JH: I am convinced from listening to various interviews that Roger Corman could charm anybody into anything
J: Oh! Sure!
JH: ‘Cause he’s just--he’s a sweet guy--
J: It’s the way he talks, too, man, he enunciates every word and he speaks very clearly
JH: Yes, he does
[Plays clip of Roger Corman speaking in an interview] 
J: And that’s the key to his success
JH: That’s how he gets--
R: [Puts his hands on the sides of his head] I’m dooooooooomed!! [Everyone laughs] 
JH: I’m convinced, I--I’m absolutely convinced that that is how Roger Corman gets movies made. [Enunciates clearly] “We’re making a sequel to Carnosaur”
J: Yeah
JH: “And we’re going to have an Aliens (?) plot…”
R: [Talks excitedly] “We’re doing a sequel to Carnosaur and we’re gonna have an--a plot like a--A--Aliens!”
J: Yeah, see, that doesn’t sound...I’m not buying that
JH: You gotta be stentorian 
R: [Stammers] “Do you have like a half a day so you can (?) on the movie?”
JH: “Michael, we have half a day available for you. Would you like to be...a helicopter pilot?” [Rich chuckles] I feel like I’m doing Adam West now [Rich laughs]
J: That’s--that’s--that’s pretty close
R: Just gotta--just gotta throw in “old chum” on the end
JH: Old chum 
J: [Chuckling] Old chum...
JH: “Would you like to be a helicopter pilot for half a day, old chum?”
R: Holy carnosaur, Batman!

[24:48] JH: Wait a minute, let me stop you right here. Jay
J: Yes?
JH: Is there a dog in this movie?
J: There’s not a dog...in this movie [Josh and Rich laugh] There’s not a dog in The Skateboard Kid, and there’s not a dog in The Skateboard Kid 2
JK: Oh my god!
J: They keep fucking shoving these dogs--you know what? This dog is the family friendly version of the hot babe...from Carnosaur 2 [Rich laughs] 
JH: All that people wanna see, the babe!
J: Same shit!
JK: They’re bamboozling us!
J: They’re constantly tricking us
JK: I feel conned!...Maybe in the un-family friendly edit, the dog was there, but it got gruesomely murdered…[Rich and Jay laugh] by a carnosaur!
J: By a carnosaur?
JH: Ohh
JK: Because he was trying to protect his hot babe owner! 
JH: OHHHH shit!
J: It’s the Carnosaur Cinematic Universe? [Points to the movies on the table] All these movies are connected? 

[27:25] R: This movie rates much lower on the woah-ometer
(...)
JK: Fucking hell!
J: You all suck!
R: They--they couldn’t afford the high-performance skateboarders that they could afford for The Magic Skateboard 1
J: None of ‘em can land!

[31:40] [Replays Jack’s laugh, then plays a clip of George McFly laughing] 

[32:22] J: There’s(?) not even subtle magic, he’s just making utensils change
JH: Yeah, yeah
J: In midair
R: Magic, or technology we don’t understand yet?
Jay and Josh: Ohhhh
JH: Rich, are you saying all magicians are aliens?
R: It’s a quote from the one that’s not Isaac Asimov, that other one, who said that
JH: Hyland? (?)
R: Who’s the...who’s the--the--the Sp--Space Odyssey guy?
JH:....Oh!
J: Clarke?
JH: Arthur...Arthur C. Clarke
R: Arthur C. Clarke!
J: Yeah
JH: Ohhh
R: And he speci….“sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”
JH: So, what you’re saying is, this movie has a 2001 connection? [Jay laughs]
R: Ohhh my goddd! Is that why I wanna beat it with, like, a bone? Just--
JH: As long as you toss it upward into the sky and it turns into--
R: [Pretends to throw something upward] Ahhhh! 
J: Toss up The Skateboard Kid 2 VHS tape into the sky
R: Look at it sitting there, like some kind of horrible monolith! [Jay laughs and removes the case]
[They edit the The Skateboard Kid 2 VHS tape into where the monolith goes in the ending scene from 2001] 

[36:03] J: So they concoct this plan, where Bruce Davison takes Dee Wallace, the skateboard kid’s mom, out on a date [She dumps a plate of spaghetti on the guy’s lap and leaves]
JK: “I was gonna fuck that later” 
J: [Laughs] The spaghetti or her?
JK: The spaghetti

[37:00] J: Oh no, he’s dressed like one of the Columbine shooters [Rich laughs]
JH: Ohhhh…
J: Things are gonna get dark
R: I didn’t know Columbine started over a skateboard

[38:11] J: She--she’s, yeah, she’s permanently injured from the waist down, she can’t feel anything, she’s in a wheelchair the rest of her life. That’s what I’m assuming [Rich bursts into laughter, Jack tries to say something] All f-or-all for a fucking skateboard
JK: She messed up her life, she can no longer have children…

[41:04] JH: Rich…
R: Yeah?
JH: Would you like to tell us about Future Zone?
R: Future Zone? David--David Carradine, who, you know, was the--the star of, you know, the previous installment. In the early 90s, he made a follow up, uh, where he teams up with his son, and then they go on, like--like--like, cop dramas, and then when Kung Fu: The Legend Continues failed as a series, they made Future Zone [Josh laughs]
JK: You nailed it [Everyone claps] 

[48:15] R: [As David Carradine] “You know I’m the best cop on the force, right? [He and Josh chuckle] I solve all the crimes!”
JK: But he’s not--he’s not a detective, he is Space Cop
JH: Yeah
JK: He solves all crimes by--
J: Yeah, but Space Cop’s a comedy! [Rich and Jack chuckle]
JH: Well, this movie perhaps should’ve been
R: Space Cop was a comedy, OH SHIT I played that all wrong!

[50:54] [“In loving memory of David Carradine” appears in front of a clip of him drinking]

[51:00] JH: Uhh, I would like to know what is everybody’s choice for best of the worst, I’m gonna start wiiiith Rich!
R: I got no fucking clue
