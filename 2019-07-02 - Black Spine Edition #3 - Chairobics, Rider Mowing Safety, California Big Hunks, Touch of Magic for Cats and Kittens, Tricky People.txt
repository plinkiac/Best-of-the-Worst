why hello Jay
oh great
another black spine episode
this is the worst thing we do
let's get it over with
wrong
we are doing another black spine episode
but this time there's a twist
I present to you black spine Jenga
Jesus Christ
what are we doing
I don't know
each day gets more and more embarrassing
well Jay
I'm going to assume that you and our audience knows the rules to Jenga
actually we'll call this something else because Jenga is a trademark
I present to you junka
because all the tapes are junk
junka is played much like Jenga
each player removes one tape at a time from any level below the top using
one hand only then instead of placing
the removed tapes back on the top a copy
of new key will be put at its place
instead the removed tapes will then be
added to each player's pile the player
that causes the tower to fall will be
the loser the winner will thus be
rewarded by forcing everyone to watch
all of the tapes he's pulled from the
junka pile well like a normal black
spying episode the tapes have no labels
on their spine some have information on
the face of the tape some are completely
blank and we have absolutely no idea
what's on them it could be a movie could
be an instructional video could be
filthy porno there may be a copy of I
want to but your grandma in here we
don't know that was oddly specific okay

isn't cuz they've got the base like a
great tall over how many cigarette burns
do you think are in that carpet
it was a white carpet Oh God
yeah this is like a serial killer video
what are you gonna stop we had enough
hey guys we watched all of these
videotapes I hate black spine we watched
all these and more Ju you fought tooth
and nail to destroy Mike
you you were a true competitor today
was it fucking worth it
it was fun
that part of it was fun
and the mystery is what magic was in my pile of tapes
we will only know tomorrow when everybody comes back
nope
you can go fuck yourself
there is some good stuff there
we have 22 tapes and we have condensed it down to a handy 5
these are the only ones that didn't go completely in the garbage
and even these are hanging by a thread
we weren't going to talk about 22 tapes
so we started tossing ones that that we didn't want to watch anymore
um, uh
simple gladiator rules
yeah
yeah
so Mike because I know
this is a special passion of yours why
don't you tell everyone about chair
robux well for our first tape not our
first taping watch but your first tape
we enjoyed was chair robux
and if it's it's laughing at the elderly
well it's a combination of elderly doing
some form of exercise a tiny pathetic
set and completely inappropriate music
this music it's not feel like it's
getting louder like they're trying to do
some sort of subliminal mind thing party
now yeah that's get exciting like you
you do understand that some day some day
in the not-too-distant future you are
really going to get your comeuppance I
know why that's fair I think so one day
we will all be elderly yeah and
hopefully people will laugh I see you
won't live that long no oh yeah that's
true I guess maybe all of us won't be
elderly something to think about we can
only hope I think there's an old Ray
Bradbury short story but I banned
stranded on a planet that's deserted
mmm-hmm like like everyone else is dead
or something I don't remember the
details but to pass the time he sets up
like pre-recorded messages just taunting
himself when he's older and doesn't
remember it and then he is older now and
dealing with his past self being a dick
to him okay are you saying with this
video there may be time travel involved
in one of these elderly people is
possibly really Mike that's what it
looked like a Star Wars droid it was a
signal time Mike was trying to let us
know okay in the future he made exercise
videos well I guess in the future you
travel to the past this is very
complicated to make exercise videos yeah
I invented the osteoporosis dance you
were the videographer for it's this but
the tape itself oh it starts off by the
way with with a lengthy medical
disclaimer if this is your first time
using the video I suggest you forward to
the section on education for persons
with lung disease please consult your
physician if you are a newcomer to
exercise don't think you need to
complete the entire routine your first
week
to monitor your work of breathing we
will use the Borg perceived exertion
scale this scale ranges from 6 to 20 or
19 to 21 20 is the most difficult work
you could perform how did for 10 second
if your doctor has prescribed an inhaled
bronchodilators medication such as
albuterol should aim to work in the
range of 11 to 13 for 12 to 20 minutes
220 - 60 - 70 if your heart rate is
increased from your medication you might
exceed this range that equals 112 then
multiply 160 by 80% to 80% of this this
is important to prevent injury
I started to feel like this tape like
many elderly exercise tapes or scans a
real exercise tape instructing adults
has an actual routine probably knows a
little bit about exercise when you act
when you teach the elderly to exercise
it's basically just telling them to
slightly move and remember when you're
an old you can't move too much because
your bones are brittle and your muscles
are deteriorating and your body is
falling apart in front of your very eyes
and that's where the hilarity comes in a
lot of white pants for people who are
probably wearing I guess it's common
sense right okay so like lift your leg
or turn your body to stretch but maybe
yeah like you said unless someone's
telling you to do it in these particular
instructions maybe you might not do it
yeah and and the one guy future be
without oxygen tube after just literally
two minutes he had a sweat going under
his armpits he was not in the best shape
II he probably had well none of them
none of them are in the best shape I
know that one gram in the back with with
the the child actress haircut oh I
forgot who said she was giving it to the
chair really that was my problem this
video overall is that it just got way
too sexual
Oh looks like we have with something
that sure yeah
oh now this is getting ready for that
anal video the elderly grandma anal
video all right everybody I want to but
your grandma well elderlies can still
have sex and they need to know how to
thrust the pelvis if you put in some of
that sexy music from hot Hollywood honks
California big hunks
it's the pornography Cinematic Universe
big hu-, big, big California hunks buttfucking grandma
this is gonna be the next tape
does it start off with with grandpa's hand, like, the oxygen up
cuz he's gonna need it
here comes Reno
it's, it's all gonna lead up to the fisting gauntlet
the what
the, in-fisting gauntlet
oh
i'm out
yeah
that's fair
so let's keep talking about buttfucking
right
uh, what else is there to say about elderlies
none, go
none, we're done
next
next
keep it moving
just a reminder: these are the winners
two, three, and rest
whoo
up again
up
two
i just sat down, you bitch
can I just say again, though, I can't think of one off the top of my head but our black spines have brought about finding finding some magic
and we're, we're doing
we've got minutes of entertainment out of them
push the whopper button
so we're doing we're doing good
work where would you say we're doing the
Lord's work we're doing the Lord's no
one else is gonna sift through these
tapes much much like the last film about
what sex we're doing the Lord's work
listen can I make an apt analogy much
like the very last tape we watched which
was venison meat processing yeah which
was about five seconds oh yeah man
cutting open a deer carcass and about to
go through the process of this is how
the sausage is made
we're doing we're doing the
behind-the-scenes work that's true
winding the funny bits or you at home
we're sifting through black spine
garbage and and yes it may be
treacherous and may be painful but it's
all L and and the effort of trying to
find that diamond in the rough yeah
our next tape tour was officially called
riding mower safety presented by twirl
I'll take this one I'm kind of in charge
here so I'll take this one which is this
is a very standard one we get a lovely
disclaimer this video is intended to be
a learning tool for the entire family
while it contains several entertaining
visual surprises the overall message is
extremely serious well I think of them
disclaimer at the beginning it says
something like some of this footage is
exaggerated and crazy and then we're
like ooh who they're gonna fake
accidents that could be well then it
turns out it's just like the little kids
ball lands in front of the lawn mower
and I says oh excuse me but just as you
would when driving a car always look
back in the direction you are
look at that little little animation
there look where you going
so look where you're going and don't run
anybody over you really need a video for
this they do they do then the card turns
into like like a cartoon Corvette yeah
there's a weird cartoon thing going on
in this on
what the fuck
what just happened
but what we get is a love
ballad to the riding lawnmower that's
the big takeaway I mean there's the only
takeaway there's other things going on
in here but that there is well you
there's some there's some things there's
some Momo's being lon someone's being
mowed sure enough what long pants
sensible shoes why did sexy music come
up store gasoline an approved container
because of this suggestive imagery
that's why
at what point along the process of
manufacturing this is somebody say let's
write a love ballad it's really good -
its catchy and we can't remember now
because then we watched 47 others a road
it was it was catchy when we watched it
the world around you
staying alert to the like okay get some
final like a light in the sky always use
your machine and its attachments in
well-lit conditions like a light in the
sky don't fall asleep
and and so it's very possible that just
you know like Jimmy in upper management
at Toro like he's a closeted songwriter
and he just wanted to get that out so he
produced this video so hey guys I know a
musician who made you some tracks not me
personally for the CEOs like like son
ones music career yeah yeah my kids
music video but it's gonna be a part of
my lawn mower videos
yes
because I'm also a greedy son of a bitch
doing everything you do
always taking time to do it right
knowing how to see it through
look at you
bright as any light
I think this is the perfect video I
think it's I think it's beautifully
executed they knew just the right amount
of creativity to keep you watching the
whole time so that they don't get sued
when you run your child over and they're
like we played it safe for most of the
video let's do a love ballad that's the
other one kind of going over the line
just enough the brilliance video about
lawnmowers I have been emotionally moved
by a lot of
beautiful song information about
lawnmowers that's it because next we
have Oh God and I mean I hate to play
the stereotypes I do but the people want
it Jay can you please tell us about
California big huh what's the stereotype
that I'm a California big hunk that you
like talking about buff guys in
California talk about California big
haha come on man listen I would love to
talk about California big hunks there's
this fart music so California Highway
Patrol chips character yeah yeah this
should be music in like Revenge of the
Nerds or something it starts with a cop
pulling some woman over giving her a
ticket and then we do like a pixelated
dissolve into him in a bedroom stripping
I can't even dance to the beat of this
music it's like two music tracks layered
on top of each other yeah and both were
performed by cats running on pianos he's
playing the keyboard with his boner it's
like they're playing fart noises with
the synthesizer it's robot farts but
that dancing is so like well how could
you dance to this is this gonna get
x-rated a villain it's gonna be like a
Chippendales saying or a system like a
speedo yeah move on to the next
characters character I'll just be a
series of stripping but they have to be
California specific characters so what's
the next California character if it were
more modern it would be someone who
definitely has a podcast
sterility movie until we until we cut
back from the fantasy The Dude's done
stripping and then we realize it's him
looking up and he's been fantasizing
about himself taking off his clothes
which makes sense
California hunks, they're all fuck narcissists
I guess that's what it is yeah
but that first one it's like okay a sexy
cop dude hunky cop dude this is like you
know stripper costume one California
Highway sure whatever but then we cut to
Cletus and like a filthy swamp your
first thought is redneck stripper but
but no it's so much worse the fantasies
what the fuck is he wearing
tell me you're not interested in seeing
every single like okay sexy cop got it
yeah like what is this this is this is
Kraven the hunter this is the use of
spider-man villains auditioning for cats
he's wearing like it like a what like an
african tribesmen outfit with a mullet
and mustache and a fake torso printed
out just the weirdest parties he's
wearing a shirt of his chest but there's
like fringe on it and he has furry boots
yeah and it is somatically it doesn't
make a lot of sense it's insane but this
is this is no longer California big
hunks it's like what happened things
then take a real bad turn once we start
seeing cletus's hole thank God I was out
of the room rich had an allergic
reaction he coincidentally had to leave
the room
suddenly go to the bathroom is the
storyline 
oh, he brought out a filthy blanket
it's covered in shit
see I think his name was Reno not Cletus can we not
use offensive stereotypes Reno was just
a simple fisherman but I think his
outfit was supposed to be like like
Native American or tribal Sam he was yes
he was he was envisioning himself as
like a hunter-gatherer if someone from
the past who lived in nature okay and
and his fantasy then
I'm gonna ride around on the ground exposing my balls
I'm gonna pull out a shit-covered blanket and laid on the ground in the swamp and and yeah thrust into it
but that's when you're starting to wonder
cuz we're like oh maybe this is the type
of video that you know women play at
bachelorette parties in the background
for fun like Buffalo Bill had a creepy
face but a nice body super creepy face
very creepy face but you know like he
was he was a good stripper but he's
doing like generic dancing but it's like
whatever but then we get to the second
one we're like oh wait is this intended
for gay men we weren't sure we get what
we get to the cowboy he's like normal
cowboy man they're like oh rugged cowboy
man that's another like kind of thing
you would expect women to be fantasizing
about of course but then he starts
fantasizing about himself and he's
wearing like it's like like flashy
cowboy costume he's a comer cowboy it's
a glamour cowboy and so we're like I
don't know who this is aimed at this is
weird
weird
this one's really weird it's Robert
Ginty but you want him to look like a
real cowboy it runs to the fantasy right
not a marching band cowboy right
I don't even it just wants to die Oh
should we fast-forward to the next guy
yeah I got it that's all I care about
anymore just just just so we're clear
Mike didn't want us to fast forward
through the stripping cowboy you're
forgetting one major segment though the
asexual segment and now Donnie there's
like weird like metal bars and like like
structure around and then a brick wall
and he's t-tests out of spray paint and
then he sees a picture on the wall we
can tell we couldn't tell what it was
because it's all wrinkled yeah and it's
reflecting light reflecting I thought it
was a picture of a corpse we couldn't
tell what it was oh no what Michael
Jackson there was a picture of Michael
Jackson on the wall Oh a graffiti artist
saw a picture of Michael Jackson on a
wall and now fantasizing himself as
Michael Jackson stripping that's what's
happening and then he's wearing he's got
the black shoes in the white socks and
the military suit oh and then you know
these are the the the ruins of a 17th
century village I'll just like I don't
think there is anything inherently sexy
about Michael Jackson's dance routines
yeah Michael Jackson's dancing is just
dancing and then including it with
stripping
in in a rural village somewhere in
Europe it's all very confusing
he's like looking above you the whole
time yeah why is the camera off ten feet
I'm watching demo but but we kept
looking for excuses to turn off the
video but every gap drawn is a character
that was introduced it's like what are
you do yeah well the first one is like
okay sexy cop bedroom boom got it
easy peasy and then it gets like worse
and worse and weirder and weirder gets
weirder and weirder and then the Michael Jackson guy like you could tell he didn't want to be like half naked in public
so just as he starts to take his pants off they cut to him in front of like a mural of clouds
and you're, like, where the fuck is he now
now the other men you can tell were like exotic dancers but him
the Michael Jackson guy had he had the
Michael Jackson moves men around yeah
he's not a stripper but actually maybe a
Michael Jackson impersonator right yeah
just was desperate not anymore ya know
my theory was was that he showed up to
an audition to be a backup dancer for
Michael Jackson and he one thing led to
another and you know in the wrong room
he got more than he bargained part of
the Michael Jackson video we're doing
yeah we doing something else
California big hunks next best thing you
can down key who can't use 50 bucks to
take your pants off come to my castle
come coming to my tour around Cairo and
service make me a pain thought why is
the camera ten feet up in the air what
am I
he just keeps looking off at Notley
dance like jack oh that was a pants off
there was a general theme of like very
man you won't take your pants off
outside
okay we'll film the rest of it my kid's
playroom that is fam yeah that's the
slogan for the production look at Reno
Employee of the Month so you know got a
brain eating amoeba okay I'm leaving
leaning 98 percent gay men vs. and 2
percent female bachelor party tape it
was no Magic Mike dancing yeah well as
we mentioned later there was a lot of
things like in the late 80s where it was
unintentionally homoerotic or maybe this
was meant to appeal to women more
homoerotic aliens or people who've been
made for alien people from the future or
for the past time travel into every time
traveling gay men because they're like
oh that's supposed to POC elliptic chic
like I don't know what it is sexy
Michael Jackson in a breakdown process
it like I don't know maybe it was made
for just one guy the guy that made the
tape yeah well and we're forgetting or
forgetting about like prints knock off a
prompts
oh yeah yeah yeah there's more
characters there's more we started in
the fast forward we had had enough
yeah yeah it's really funny when they
dance and fast forward
yeah but through there was even even man
who went on date oh and this stood up by
his female Bailey goes to Walker
immediately goes to the gym which I
guess is connected to the restaurant I
don't know maybe she didn't show up to
the date because he was taking her out
to the gym cafeteria oh yeah she's like
it smells like balls in here maybe it's
meant to appeal to everybody a little
you know a little bit for everybody at
it cast a wide net catch a lot of fish
family fun for all yeah I would show
this children for families yeah
we barely started
rich our next our next tape was a touch
of magic for cats and kittens and you
being the cat lover that you are
touching tell us please all about a
touch of magic a touch of magic for cats
is a instructional video slash seminar
by a crazy con lady who just wants to
pet her cat she prefers to be called a
con artist there's an artistry to what
she does
and what we found when we did actually to biofeedback research projects using an English-developed instrument called the mind mirror
all four brainwave patterns
when i first saw this on the screen, i thought, this can't be happening
used for old age
reproductive problems?
what
rubbing the cat's--
oh, my god
don't fucking touch your cat's reproductive organs
no, jay
rubbing the cat's ear will solve all those problems, like old-age, respiratory problems
your cat just gets younger as you rub its ear
knows her touching techniques work
because they hooked cat up to a mind
mirror a device made in England that I
guess measures brainwaves measures brain
alpha waves the beta waves and they show
different measurements yeah when it's
scientifically proved that you can be a
jack app by touching its ear all these
all these wonderful claims they pop them
up on the screen every now and then it's
different every time they pop up and we
should point out it will show what it's
supposed to accomplish on the screen
here but all of this is accomplished by
petting the cat okay okay so correct you
there's ear stroking and then there is
petting and they both cure different
one the first one it's like what is old
h1 is like like breathing problems
something with their reproductive and
then and she's going like this stroking
the ears from the base of the ear gently
all the way out to the tips and my
forefinger is folded and gently inserted
into my ear so it's back against the
side here and I support the year as I
stroke rubbing your own eyes she's
saying different levels of pressure to
apply she does it on her forearm
yeah you say like if you stop breathing
that's too hard
breathing no she's like if you're doing
this and you and you you lose your
breath it's too hard okay to get a nine
you'd go three times deeper try it it
stops your breath there was a lot of
like you know energy and sending sending
to a magic and like the walls are like
giant helmet on the captain no the data
just comes out just as happy and now go
back to the three feel that three
pressure
and go back to your arm and make that
pressure and look at the amount of
indentation you see the difference
between the three and then go back to the one
what the fuck is happening
she's explaining the amount of pressure to apply when you rub your cat's eyelids
that's what's happening
this lady's a grade-a crackpot
i did Google mind mirror
yeah
and I saw a couple images that look like pure quackery
it looked like the thing that that that he wears and ghostsbusters
cool oh yeah yeah yeah under her head so
I'm gonna based off of not reading any
articles I'm gonna assume quackery sure
someone's gonna tell us differently
might in the comments well those if
those people get too worked up or too
upset that we're portraying this wrong
someone just rubbed their ear and calm
them down or write us a lengthy email
that we'll ignore and it's worth
remembering because this area right
around the base affects the digestive
system the respiratory system and the
reproductive system when you were
talking about the the production value
of it and talking about how it was
forty-five minutes of her just talking
rise of the camera they cut to a
close-up of the cat for approximately
half a second they cut back and she
maybe do five minutes and at first he
didn't like it he wanted to get away and
after four or five times he and this he
only cut in these higher like first half
hour of the video that's when the valium
started wearing off that's that's the
only close-up they got to the cat before
it started to fucking flip out do you do
you think they sedated the cat for the
purposes of the video that sounds about
100% yeah yeah that cat was fucked up
because it cuz you might want to jump
jump off her lap and go run around
squirming a bit and there was one moment
where she started doing something in the
cab yeah she tries to like suffocate the
thing in her chest yeah she's like shut
up shut up shut up good
it's it was it's getting antsy
I'm calming it at some point you just
twisted its neck look at work it's so
calm it doesn't move she throws it aside
and a person comes in and brings a new
one that's just like it yeah IIIi would
love to see outtakes from this make go
away that that is a thing that exists it
doesn't take you much time
it can't hurt and it's really a way of
helping to keep your hat you're a cat
healthier
somebody tried to trick people speaking
of people who try to trick people Segway
a great segue I felt it was a tricky Oh
No
an upbeat song about perverts Oh whose
good job well Mike seems to remember a
lot about this already take it back to
Mike tell us all about yellow dinos
can't fool me well much like another
film that we watched the golf
instructional video with Timmy Timmy
Toby tell me the creeper which was a
cartoon character brought to life which
looked pink a creepy horror movie yeah
monster for some reason adults think
that little children relate to giant
stuffed animals to teach them things now
the the Barney influence maybe maybe
Barney kind of started no because there
was stuff from like the 70s that had
stupid costumes
it goes back who knows where the origins
are but but the yellow dinosaur yellow
Dino his name is yellow Dino he's a he
sounds like Chris Rock I don't know why
but he's teaching child musicians about
stranger danger yeah
tricky Peter key is there is there word
yeah and they're like what's a tricky
person what do they want and he's like
oh you don't want to know what they want
oh don't ever take the job playing the
pervert someone's got to do it
listen let's do the Brenner you're right
yeah it's good for the kids but now
you're the pervert but then I can
actually take that money and go down to
the mall and then lure some kids there's
songs it's like this Barney costume it's
like the the child predator is like
peeking in the window and whoopee slips
on the garbage and it's like they're
trying to make it funny to appeal to
kids but it's still a child molester
it's video about like tell the kids like
be careful about the creepy adults who
are going to take photos of you
sexualized and they do that by taking an
actual girl oh yeah they kept it tame
enough the problem comes when you start
adding like cartoon sound effects yes
boy like don't do that remember when I
was telling you about tricking people
yeah
charming is a tricky person you do the
Barney ask like goofy stranger danger
stuff and it's just like oh watch out
for strangers they're weird not like
this music producer is going to take
nude photos it's it's so weird it
doesn't make sense and also it is not a
common thing maybe a kidnapping like
that when he says oh I've got some
kittens in my van come with me to my van
that's more common than sleazy music
producer music producer I'm wanting to
take sexual photos of an angel that's
super gorgeous in general like people
taking pictures of you it's one of those
things where like where you just have to
ask yourself is this helping yeah my
intention is there I get what they're
trying to do yeah but they're like
remember we watch shows the corny right
hello
boy how where do you come from that
yellow house over there hi corny was
like yet don't answer the door if it's a
weird guy you don't recognize it was
more general situations that a normal
person would understand more and plus it
was an adult playing a childlike alien
yes they didn't have actual kids in
these situations which makes it so much
more uncomfortable yes weird
everything about it was weird and wrong
and then in the middle of you have a guy
in a dinosaur costume it looks like more
of a predator than any of the actual
predators in the video he could the
perverts are trying to learn oh look at
that wacky pervert
you know what the weirdest part was
something that they never resolved is is
the the kind of the the loose story to
this video was lyric joining the band
right and then lyric would tell these
stories about the creepy guy who tried
to get her to go outside to his van
right and then they would cut to the
guitar player and she would have this
like you know then it goes on and then
she tells another story about this
creepy guy and she they cut back to that
never showed her story
what the fuck happened to that girl
it's in other videos and lies an expanded universe of stories
I think so
and it ties in to other yellow dino videos
because I think we had like ten of them
and I remember putting one in we
see the scene where mr. charming tries
to take sexually explicit photos of
mayor of lyric don't worry about hurting
his feelings he's given bad information
it was weird and it was uncomfortable
but opening up the conversation to kids
is important don't want to portray the
people you want the kids to stay away
from as goofy and silly yeah funny it's
about to rain fold kids well now we got
to put them back up so we can pick which
is I think we all know what this is the
worst what we do what what is it well
let's figure this once it's California big hunks
I can't believe we're fucking picking a best of the worst for this shit
that's the name of the show
we have got five tapes and what is the best of the most
oh, fuck that
jack
oh
okay
so I'm really torn
I'm gonna talk through my process here
I'm really torn between California big hunks and Toro: lawnmower safety
there's a purity tutorial there there's
a purity to Toro that then as soon as
the love ballad starts elevates it to
something weird and it like we were just
hitting the point where like okay it's
just lawn mower safety wait is that a
love ballad I'm gonna go with Toro lawn
mower safety I I never got emotional
watching a lot more safety videos that's
really yeah so there's that but rich
you're paying for best of the worst you
know I think ven is in the easy way has
some really practical information up
here oh he also had pole in it but to
start with what we're gonna do is we're
gonna cut all the way around this rectum
went into the butthole but it was still
above all very different but home yeah
I'm
my vote - I don't know sure almost in
game on I I think that's the right
answer that's my answer
California big hugs specifically with a
question mark
California big hugs that was the worst
I'm going with California big honks I
don't know who the intended audience was
for it but whoever it was
I bet really enjoying yeah I'm also
picking California although I think it
should be called big California honks I
think they messed the title up
California shouldn't even be in the time
now I think that's what this proof was
made by an alien yeah they don't know
what's happening human hugs flesh in
states this this certainly confounded us
the most is the most baffling wouldn't
you also consider the fact that it's the
best way or the biggest way you could
screw up a simple concept that's true
yeah like you renting or buying a tape
called California big hunks and I think
you know you're in a swamp it and it's
the most sexually off-putting thing
you've ever seen wait why is he getting
that dirty rug
is he dressed like Michael Jackson and
in the rubble of a castle like none of
these things are erotic that's why
that's so fast if California big hunks
was made by aliens homes what was their
plots what were the aliens trying to
accomplish this oh they they made the
tape and then they distributed it and
then they observed the humans watching
the tape to see how close they got the
human experience oh no we got that ro no
bottle okay no bottle okay their culture
does not find dirty swamps romantic big
slow Michael Jackson they didn't like
this one but we put Castle in humans
were used to live in castles I think it
gave them a lot of data - yeah better
their studies of humans that's a good
it's an educational video as well as
what you're saying now for us but for
somebody hey Liam look all I care about
is that we destroy the yellow dinosaur
video yeah video there's something going
on there behind the scene it's not right
and it ain't right yeah after the
discussion was over some mild research
was done about the tricky people table
it seems Mike did not imagine the scene
where lyric confronts mr. charming about
her erotic photographs however it was
not lyric it was that other girl what
would you think if these pictures
ended up at your school this sequence
actually appeared on a longer version of
the tricky people VHS tape upon a second
release the tape was then trimmed down
ten minutes to remove this and other
even more intense and disturbing
material the shorter version even came
with a shocking new disclaimer some of
the scenes you'll see may be hard to
think about told to the viewer by a man
in a yellow dinosaur costume it is the
final decision of the best of the worst
panel that both versions of tricky
people be destroyed well rich I think
that you hated the yellow Dino video the
most I mean we all did but now we have
to come up with a clever way to destroy
them
