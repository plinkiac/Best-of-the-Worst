Jay: Good morning, Rich Evans
Rich: Hello, Jay, how are you doing?
J: Somebody sent us a gift. Pac-Man ponchos [Opens the box, takes out the orange poncho and gives it to Rich]
R: C--Clyde? Fucking Clyde?
J: Do the Pac-Man ghosts have names?
R: Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde
J: Is this real life?
R: Yeah
J: Why do you know this?
R: If you--if you’re playing Ms. Pac-Man Clyde is Sue [Silence] Apparently Clyde--
J: Why did they change the name for Ms. Pac-Man?
R: ‘Cause Clyde was transgendered
J: I wasn’t aware of that
R: Sensitive...monster [They open the ponchos, Rich puts his on] So, what are we watching today, Jay?
J: Oh, we’re gonna watch action movies [The poncho box falls, Jay kicks the box and blue poncho out of the way]
R: Oh my god, that’s exciting, it’s all...just fucking exciting
J: Uh, why don’t you say what out first movie is?
R: Ok, uhh, Order of the Black Eagle [Shows off the tape to the camera] *Movie #1 Order of the Black Eagle* “Look out, James Bond! Here comes Duncan Jax! The newest superspy to save the world! A cult of Neo-Nazis kidnap and enslave the world’s leading laser scientist”
J: “Laser scientist”
R: “Lase sc--” so--so it’s a very specific branch of science
J: Ok. I’m unfamiliar with this, but I don’t know the sciences
R: “Now they can hold the world hostage with their devastating proton beam annihilator. Secret agent Duncan Jax takes the deadly assignment to destroy the Amazon hideout of these modern-day monsters. But he’s going to need help--and he gets it, from a beautiful Interpol agent and an awesome team of jungle commandos. It’s a furious, explosive battle of unrelenting...destruction--” I--sorry, I--I--I--I looked at the line under “destruction,” I was--”unrelenting shocking!” is what I was gonna say [Jay laughs] But that was wrong. “Unrelenting destruction…un--”
J: (?) is unrelentingly shocking
R: That would be great
J: Yeah
R: That’d be great
J: It’s just full of all sorts of offensive things
R: Just--just--just...just *bleep* [Too Hot for TV appears over Rich’s mouth] *bleep* (?) Then *bleep* Two girls one Duncan Jax
J: Oh
R: Yeah. [Continues reading] “Until the Third Reich’s most shocking secret is revealed! Now Jax must stop them! [Echoing (?)] No matter what!
J: Oh, I can’t wait to find out what the shocking secret is
R: [Tosses the tape] Let’s go watch it!
J: Is Hitler still alive? Is it gonna be that?
[In the screening room]
Mike: Is that a cryogenically-frozen Hitler? Oh my god, it is
J: Of course [Rich laughs] In case you didn’t get it
[In the VHS room]
R: Oh, oh, Hitler clones? [“Hitler clowns” appears on screen] Operation: Clone Hitler?
J: I thought you said “Hitler clowns.” That would be--
R: That is the most evil thing [Jay laughs] 
J: [Looks at the tape] This sounds like a fake name too, the director of the movie is Worth Keeter [Silence] 

[3:45] R: It’s a baboon
M: It’s a baboon in a tuxedo--
J: In a tuxedo. Are we sure this isn’t a comedy?
Josh: No
R: I hope the baboon is his chauffeur

[4:36] R: Thank God that was a bulletproof wood door

[4:41] J: Our next film is Wired to Kill
R: Oh my gorsh
J: Starring not Linda Blair and a robit (?) *Movie #2 Wired to Kill* “It’s a booby-trap--one false move and you’re history…...Emily Longstreth, from Pretty in Pink? [Rich makes a confused expression, the IMDB cast list for Pretty in Pink appears, an arrow moves down until it reaches Emily Longstreth’s name] Uh, “Merritt Buttrick, from Star Trek II…” that was Kirk’s son, right?
R: Oh, was it? I don’t know. I don’t know his name. [Silence] I’m sorry
M: It was!
J: “Devin Hoelscher from My Science Project and Tom Lister star in this step into a very bleak future, where survival is at gunpoint. They year is 1998.” [Rich stares at the ground lifelessly] The far-off distant future of 1998, Rich. “The place: Los Angeles.” Uh, “a deadly virus has wiped out most of the United States’ population.” Mutant gangs, Rich [Rich doesn’t respond] Not even that?
R: Wh--what? I’m sorry, I was just--I--
J: Gangs
R: I was just thinking about beating somebody in the head with the back end of a rifle
J: “Mutant gangs terrorize and victimize the few survivors. But when they kill his family, kidnap his girlfriend, Steve, a young computer wiz”?
R: Ohh…
J: He’s our hero? “Wages a different kind of war.” A nerd war
R: Revenge of the Nerd and the Mutant (?)
J: This should be Revenge of the Nerds part...2: Nerds in Paradise. “Steven invents(?) destructive booby traps--” oh god, “strategically set to each and every gang member. Who destroyed his family.” So he’s gonna have individual booby traps that he’s going to place on each member of the mutant gangs, Rich
R: Home Alone?
J: That’s the plot of this movie
R: Mad Max meets Home Alone
J: [Laughs] “The seemingly innocent toy robots are wired to kill!” So he’s gonna send one of these little guys…[Shows off the robot on the cover] off to kill each one of the mutant gang members
[Pause] 
R: How about that Ghostbusters trailer?
J: Oh, that looks like shit
R: I know, doesn’t it?

[7:12] JH: Is this supposed to be funny? ‘Cause it’s not funny
M: I think it’s supposed to be funny

[7:26] R: Jay, look what I found [Picks up the tape] Atlantis! [Jay gasps, Rich looks between Jay and the tape] Oh! Raiders--
J: You gotta continue, after the--after the bit
R: What’s--where do you go with that? “I found--”
M: That’s a bad example
R: It was--it was--oh! It was here! It wasn’t in the bottom of the ocean [Jay laughs] 
JH: It was just on...
R: It was just on the shelf. I found Atlaaaantis [Mike says something in the background]
J: Nobody found(?) it before
R: That’s the joke! I tried to go--I tried to just go directly into the film, but then Jay told me I needed to continue with the bit
J: No! You gotta continue from the bit
R: From the bit?
J: Yeah
R: Ohhhhh
J: And then you--then you say “Raiders of Atlantis!”
R: Raiders of Atlantis
J: There we go
*Movie #3 Raiders of Atlantis*
R: “Adventure beyond the edge of time!”
J: Oh wait, who gave it four stars?
R: Uhh, ‘inspired action and special effects”
J: Oh look, nobody gave it four stars [Rich laughs] They just put it in quotes. That’s not how that works
R: [Laughs] Nobody said this 
J: Nobody said that. There’s no citation
R: I like that line of thinking [Jay chuckles] “The year is 1994. A powerful disturbance rocks the Caribbean. From its crystal depths rises the ancient island sung of in legend, Atlantis, the lost continent”
J: Was that a sentence?
R: “Stranded by the powerful whirlpool created by the continent’s mysterious reappearance, a group of inbred adventurers set foot on the island’s forbidden shores!”
J: Are you just making stuff up?
R: Oh, what, no, no, no, intrepid. Intrepid
J: Okay
R: Oh my god
J: I was gonna say we have mutant...mutant killers, and now we have inbreds?
R: “There they--”
J: I guess we don’t, we have intrepid. That’s a very different...
R: “There the--”
M: People that are inbred are intrepid
R: Yeah!
M: You’ve got to be very, very intrepid to sleep with your sister [Rich chuckles]
R: Intrepidly exploring the depths of *bleep* “There, the daring raiders engage in deadly combat with savage plunderers, armed with an arsenal of subtle, deadly pitfalls and traps!”
J: Oh! Okay
R: Ey, yeah, they got a trap thing. “And a doomsday array of atomic weapons! Trained on the capitals of the world!” [Goes to set the tape down] Let’s go watch some movies!
J: Oh, that’s it? [The tape falls] Oh Jesus Christ. Well, I guess we’re not watching Raiders of Atlantis. Rich just broke the tape
R: I was gonna--I was gonna knock these tapes off...and walk away, but I’m just too lazy to put them back up afterwards
J: That’s not--
R: So I’m not gonna do--I’m just gonna walk away
J: Okay [Rich walks away and bumps into the camera, Jay pushes some tapes off the shelf] Oh Rich! You gotta clean up these tapes
R: [Groans] Ohhh, Jaaaay!
J: I can’t do it

[10:36] M: Soooo….
J: Now that I know what’s going on I’m okay with this movie
M: Are you kidding me?

[12:09] M: It’s so many things crammed into one movie that it’s amazing that it’s not the best movie we’ve ever seen
J: Yeah
M: Now I have a list of all the things that are in the film. Which will be visually depicted on the screen for you
JH: Oh, you typed it up
M: Yeah, I typed it up
J: We’re professionals, Josh
M: Okay, here we go. Audience, imagine a film with all these things in it. And how it cannot be awesome. James Bond gadgets, a laser scientist, a polo match, a tuxedo-wearing baboon, an ultralight plane flown by a tuxedo-wearing baboon, an eye patch-wearing Orson Welles Nazi who is impaled by a spear, a diamond heist, of course, has to be a diamond heist, a laser security grid protecting Smithsonian diamonds, a cryogenically-frozen Hitler, uh, bazookas, a guy getting his head run over [Plays clip, in the screening room, everyone exclaims]
M: Wait! Was that the real guy? [Plays clip again, continues the list] Fu Man-Q, or Q Manchu, it’s essentially the Q character from the James Bond film but he’s an Asian man (?) Fu Manchu, a bus falls off a cliff, a speedboat chase, a dirt bike chase, ancient ruins, a space laser, a high school castle set, a wild west showdown, cowboys, ninjas, drunken head-wounded banditos, a black panther, a female post-apocalyptic warrior, a crossbow-wielding Willie Nelson, a sex pervert demolition expert, uh, terrible shooting, uh, Bond girls, a dirt bike decapitation [Plays clip, in the screening room, everyone exclaims]
JH: They managed it!
M: Hitler’s face melting, uh, guy on fire, baboon driving a tank…
JH: I wanna amend that one, a baboon driving a baboon-sized tank
J: Yes
M: You’re right
J: It’s a tank specifically made for the baboon [Plays clip]
M: And then, just when you can’t think of anything else to put in here...there’s a hot air balloon
JH: Yes
M: So, Nazis escaped to South America?
J: They--they made their headquarters in the, uh, the location of the Nickelodeon show Legends of the Hidden Temple

[15:1] M: The opening of the film is, uhh….uh….
JH: It’s newsreel footage
M: Well, it’s newsreel footage, to remind you of what Hitler and the Nazis were, in case...
J: ‘Cause I forgot who Hitler was
M: Yeah
JH: He’s been in the news lately, but you never know if he’s actually gonna be in the news or not
J: I just thought he was a guy that was in the 40s that had a tiny dick, I didn’t--I forgot completely about the rest of that stuff

[20:46] J: You know they’re all thinking it. “Is he fucking that baboon?” [Josh laughs]
R: The new love interest
M: Hate to--the monkey is a terrible idea
J: Well, for our sake it’s the best idea

[23:25] JH: And then, uh, Juice shoots (?) for 45 seconds and no one dies. Because he only kills one person in the entire movie, despite the fact that he shoots about eight thousand rounds…
J: Well, his name is Juice because he drinks a lot, so…
JH: Is that what it is?
J: I’m assuming that’s the case, so--
M: I thought he was--
J: He’s not a very good shot
M: I thought he was nicknamed after OJ Simpson ‘cause he likes murdering people 
[Pause]
R: Well, he’s not very good at it, is...
M: I--like OJ Simpson
J: [Laughing] Like OJ Simpson…
R: OJ got away with it. He’s great--he’s--OJ’s a class A murderer

[26:44] R: There’s one effective stunt that they used twice, and then a horrible, horrible accident that ended up in the film
M: What was that movie where the guy fell off and hit the dumpster?
J: Oh, uh, uh High Voltage
M: Clearly, a very good stunt
J: That stunt was so good that you could watch it 20 times in a row
M: I know, I know [Plays clip of a bike running over a man’s head 19 times]
R: Mike, that was--that was only 19
M: One more time [Replays clip 20 times]
[“Our apologies. The editor thought ‘one more time’ meant one more round of twenty” appears on screen] 

[29:45] M: This movie was written by a four-year old
R: This movie was written by a baboon--he wrote himself into the movie
J: It’s a vanity project for the baboon?
JH: Oh god
R: “And at the end, I’m gonna drive a tank!”
M: First film written and directed by a baboon

[30:07] J: Rest in peace, George R.R. Martin

[31:37] M: I would feel real embarrassed if they wanted to film this movie in my neighborhood. “We need(?) the post-apocalypse. Can we use your front yard?”

[32:02] J: Their grocery store bags are very nice--
M: Yeah
J: They look like they’re made out of the same material that Kate Winslet’s dress at the Oscars was made of [Mike looks at Josh, lost] It was like this--like this black latex-looking shit
JH: Was it?
J: Yeah
JH: I didn’t watch the….
M: Jay, did you get possessed by the spirit of Joan Rivers?

[33:01] [Mike starts snickering and interrupts Josh]
M: Sorry, I was just thinking about the part when the grandma gets killed
[In the screening room]
M: Oh yes, it’s gonna happen!!
JH: Ohhhhhh shit [Rich laughs]
M: She’s wearing white! [Everyone yells “ohhh” when the grandma gets hit]
JH: Hoho
M: Yes, a morning star to the head [Bad guy licks the morning star and laughs]
JH: Dang
M: Fuck that grandma up!

[34:24] M: It cuts--hard cuts and he’s in bed and you think it’s post-coital…?
J: Yes
M: And then, two seconds later, the window breaks and some guy jumps through and on top of him and starts fucking him [Jay deflates] And w...I was just like, “what’s going on?!” 

[35:02] M: Oh no, Grandma!

[35:07] M: End scene, end scene!
JH: Not end scene, because they break both of Steve’s legs, for some reason
R: Then end scene. And then we’re…
M: No, no, no, that was Grandma that broke both of his legs
JH: Noooo
M: Yes! Yes!
JH: No, what the fuck are you talking about?
J: What? The fuck’s--
JH: No!
M: All the bad guys left, and Grandma comes in with the...the sledgehammer [Jay laughs] Yes, Josh
JH: You are making this up
M: No, I was watching, and she’s like, [In an evil/crotchety old woman voice] “Steve, you’re never leaving me!”
JH: No, it was fucking Captain Kirk’s kid
M: Shut up--
J: “Never gonna leave me”
M: Uhh, Grandma...Grandma was in love with Steve. And it was obvious from the beginning
J: You’re writing your own fanfiction. You’re--you are a (?) Wired to Kill fanfiction as we were watching the movie
JH: How much--
R: He’s shipping--he’s shipping the--the--the son and--and the grandmother
JH: Oh god
M: Steve used his robot to fight a post-apocalyptic Boo Radley [Jay deflates]
JH: What the f--
M: In Wired to Kill a Mockingbird

[36:28] M: Oh my god, he’s burning a dollar bill [Camera focuses on Rich staring at the tv lifelessly] That’s not impressive

[37:29] R: I hate this dumbass

[41:57] R: That’s right, he needs to get his robot that looks like that BattleBot that always loses

[42:08] JH: Becky is getting, what’s--what’s the term?
R: Well, well, she’s being--she’s tied up
JH: Yeah
R: And--
JH: She’s like--she’s like, like, fuckin’....
J: Crucified, almost
JH: Yeah
R: And Kirk’s son, David, is--is forcing her to read Shakespeare [Plays clip] 
J: Against her will
M: Rich Evans coined the term…
R :”Plaype”
[Silence]
J: Becky got playped
[In the screening room]
M: “Every year one woman is forced to read Shakespeare against her will” [Everyone laughs]
[At the table] 
R: And she is crying, because this is a fucking horror story

[45:40] JH: And all you see is, like, Becky with, like, blood spatter all over her and she’s crying, “what the fuck happened”
R: She’s probably thinking “thank God Steve is dead”

[46:35] [“written and directed by Franky Schaeffer” appears on screen]
M: Oh, Franky, ya picture’s embarassin’

[50:47] R: I just know someone saw Road Warrior
J: Yeah
[Silence]
R: And did it wrong
J: That describes a loooot of movies
JH: That’s true
J: Especially a lot of Italian movies
M: The only thing Italians should make is pizza
R: Isn’t pizza actually an American invention?
M: Uhh...no...I think it’s an Americanized version of--
J: What we think of pizza is--
M: Italian pizza’s very different, I think
R: Okay
[They watch in silence for a bit]
M: Except for the Domino’s, the bacon-wrapped crust, uh...cheese-stuffed bacon-wrapped….
J: [Chuckles] That’s authentic
M: That’s authentic
JH: That’s 100%....[Jay laughs] 

[51:49] R: “I’m Italian, I’m gonna rip that off!”
M: Oh, Italians…..We stole your pizza, you stole all of our movies
J: Well--
M: How embarrassing
J: Mad Max wasn’t an American...movie, that was an Australian--
M: Oh, fuck you

[56:19] J: Uh, someone gets set on fire…
M: Yes
J: Which is great
JH: That happens in all three movies, that was our connective tissue

[58:23] M: She wants to smooch the elderly man
JH: Yeah
M: Who I guess was in the film
JH: He was there
M: Was that the--
JH: Most of the time
M: Was he in the film before?
JH: Yeah
M: (?)
JH: Yeah. He was the protagonist
R: Prota-gun-ist? [Pretends to shoot a gun]
M: [Laughs] He puts the “gun” in “protagonist”

[1:00:22] M: Ohhh so this movie is how AIDS started

[1:02:13] R: Josh, [Stammers] what’s the worst?
JH: Alright, if we’re talking absolute worst
J: Well, if we were talking about what we would wanna destroy
R: Yes, what would you wanna destroy?
JH: Uh, both of those [Points to Wired to Kill and Raiders of Atlantis] 
M: Yeah….[Silence] Um…[Everyone laughs]
