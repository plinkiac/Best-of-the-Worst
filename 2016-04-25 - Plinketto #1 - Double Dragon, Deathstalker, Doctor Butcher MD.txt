Mike: Eww…oh! Hi Rich Evans
Rich: [Suddenly perks up] Oh hi Mike! 
M: What have you been up to lately? 
R: I’ve been kind of busy this week, I’ve been doing some work for Bob Barker; the former host of The Price is Right
M: Really? What kind of work?
R: Well, he’s had me spaying and neutering all of his pets. He owns tigers... [Growl sound effect plays]
M: Ouch!
R: In unrelated news, I’ve also built this Plinko—I—I—I mean, this legally distinct Plinketto board.
M: Oh my god, it’s amazing! We could use this to randomly select terrible VHS films
R: [Covers mouth with hand] I didn’t even think of that! I just put these tapes at the bottom of the board ‘cause I had figured it needed some color, but yeah!
M: Wow, what a great addition to the series Best of the Worst
[There’s uncomfortable silence between the two, music plays on in the background] 
M: Well, Rich, explain to us how Plinketto works
R: Haven’t you seen The Price is Right?
M: ….What movies do we have?
R: Doctor Butcher, MD
M: Star Crystal
R: Striker!
M: Voodoo Black Banker? [Looks closer] Voodoo Black Exorcist
R: [In a funny voice] Deathstalker
M: Player’s choice	
R: Alien Chasers
M: Double Dragon
R: Going Overbooooard!
M: Viking Massacre
R: [In a weird voice] Metalbeast!
M: Richard Evans from Milwaukee Wisconsin, are YOU ready to play Plinketto?
R: [Jumps up and down] Yeah! Yeah!
M: Let’s play!
R: [Grabs ladder and loudly drags it towards the board] [Breaking glass, clanking noises come from behind the board]
M: Be very careful going up that ladder
R: Where’s the puck?
M: What?
R: The puck!
M: I don’t know, you built the thing! [Rich looks around] You gotta drop a thing—
R: Hold on, hold on [Climbs back down]
M: Jesus Christ…I don’t got all day! [Rich moves the ladder to its original position, walks off-screen] Why would you move the ladder if you’re just going to get the puck? You’re just gonna have to move the ladder back—[Ladder is noisily being dragged back]
R: Oh-ho, ladder’s caught on something [Even louder clanking noises are heard, Rich climbs once more] All right
M: You ready?
R: I’m ready [Drops puck]
M: Oh my god, oh my god…
R: Ya-a-a-ay…. [The Price is Right losing horn plays]
M: It’s Double Dragon
R: Did I—Did I— Did I win?
M: No, everyone’s a loser

[5:07] [Double Dragon title card shows up, "somewhere in China" appears onscreen]
M: Be more specific
Jack: China is a large country, you guys....

[5:24] M: Oh, THAT village, I know where this is at

[5:37] M: A scone killed my father

[5:50] R: That curtain will stop them!

[6:26] [Back at Plinketto board] 
JK: [In a game show host voice] Weeell, let’s move on to our next contestant, Jaaaaay Bauman
J: Why is this board making everybody talk like a weirdo?

[6:55] JK: Holy moly, Jay, we got Deathstalker. This, based on the cover, looks like an awesome movie
J: Never judge a VHS tape by its cover ‘cause I can guarantee the movie’ll look nothing fucking like this
JK: I’m disappointed already
J: But it does star Playboy Playmate of the Year Barbi Benton
JK: [Wolf-whistles]
J: Yeah “Journey to an age of awesome magic. Deathstalker, the last great warrior king” [Indicates the monster on the cover]  He’s not gonna fight anything like this in the movie, nothing...
JK: Oh, I really hope he does, I kind of love that thing

[8:02] J: “Bored of petty brawls and willing wenches”? Who gets bored of willing wenches? 
JK: Well, when your name is Deathstalker...
J: [Laughs] Is that his name? Is that his first or last name?
JK: That’s—both, it’s like Prince
J: Ok
JK: The artist formerly known as Deathstalker
J: [Continues reading] “And bent on revenge for past wrongs, this handsome, lustful fighter sets off—“
JK: Wait, so he’s lustful and bored of wenches?
J: I—I—I think, you see where this is going, he’s lustful but he’s bored with wenches...
JK: Ohhh, he’s going after the wizards
J: This was a very progressive film for its time
JK: It’s great

[9:02] J: There’s not gonna be any monster like this in the movie, but there will be plenty of boobs, is my guess
JK: I’ll take boobs if I can’t get monster, let’s go watch it. Whose boobs? Playboy boobs?
J: Uh, Deathstalker’s boobs
JK: Yay, man boobs!

[9:22] [In viewing room]
JK (?): Damn girl
M: He looks like Khan. He has Khan—
R: Guess there’s gonna be some rape after all!
J: No, she’s willing, she’s a willing wench. According to the back of the box, they’re all willing wenches
M: He’s keeping—he’s checking for breast—[Everybody laughs] “No lumps are good”
R: “We should get that looked at”
M: Doctor Deathstalker [More laughter] “I stalk cancerous tumors”
R: “I prescribe leech”
J: It’s all we’ve got

[10:09] M: Woah, he’s got a lightsaber now

[10:14] Deathstalker: The third power
R: [In a croaky voice]  What?

[10:36] Cave troll: You don’t have anything to eat, do you?
[Mike and Jay laugh]  
JK: What?
M: That was awesome!
J: I didn’t realize we were watching an avant-garde film
R: What’d he say?
J: “You don’t have anything to eat, do ya?”

[11:25] R: Look at this whimsical rape riot! [Everyone laughs]
JK: The merry old land of wizards, warriors, and RAAAAAPE

[11:58] R: Remember Tic-Tac-Dough? It was a game show. They played tic-tac-toe
Josh: [From atop the ladder]  Vowels!
R: They turned that into a show. How stupid do you have to be to watch a game show that’s tic-tac-toe? You put the thing in the center and then you make a line! Fucking idiots

[12:34] R: Josh, you have won Doctor Butcher
JH: Hurrah! The classic from Paragon Video. We all know how good Paragon Video is. Very excited about Doctor Butcher, MD. [Reading the back of the box] “Doctor Butcher, MD. He is depraved, sadistic rapist,” semicolon, “a bloodthirsty killer....and he makes house calls”
R: Oh, you know, hey, house calls
JH: That’s impressive; you know not a lot of people do that these days
R: House calls, rape, rape, house calls, ehh
JH: That’s tough, it’s a tough line to walk
M: [From off-screen] He makes the house calls TO rape. So you’re not getting the implication there
R: Sorry
JH: Oh ok. “A mad doctor’s deranged dream of creating perfect people by taking the parts of one person and interchanging them with another backfires as his creations develop strange side effects. Running time approximately 81 minutes”
R: Ok
JH: That’s it
R: That’s it? Ok [Looks down] Watch—watch where you’re standing, that sign, that’s the structural support. I really—I had no idea what I was doing when I built this—
JH: That’s—that’s—
R: I just—I just—I just started slapping wood together and...
JH: Rich, this—this is—this is---the sign is structural?
R: It’s holding the whole thing together
JH: That’s an engineering miracle
R: It’s a miracle [Creaking noise is heard] 
JH: We need to, um, call some people and get some papers written so…
[Creaking gets louder]
JH: Is it making that noise? Do you hear that?
M: Jesus
JH: Rich, Rich!

[14:04] [In viewing room]
Reporter lady: What’s that?
Anthropology doctor lady: It’s a ceremonial knife for human sacrifice
M: It’s unrelated. For hospital mutilations (?)
[Camera zooms in on knife, 8-bit tune plays]
J: Your princess is in another castle

[14:28] M: Which one are they saying?

[14:52] JH: She’s just, yeah, 100% fucked

[15:14] M: So, on this terrible, terrible episode of Best of the Worst we watched 3 terrible films, um, that were all terrible. Have I said terrible yet?
R: You didn’t say it enough times. You need to say it 5 more times—
JH: How were the movies?
M: Terrible, terrible, terrible

[15:47] M: Rich, let’s, uh, talks about our first film, The Photon Effect, err, no—Double Dragon

[16:51] M: Well, what was the film about, what was the heart of the film?
R: Ehh, uhh, ugh, ehh
JH: That’s correct
R: The T1000 wants the other half of a magic amulet
M: For what purpose?
R: So he can—so he can turn into—he can already—the one half he has lets him turn into like a…flat…ghost…shadow? But if he has the other half he can be like, a really strong ghost shadow?
M: He gets the other half at the end
R: He gets it at the end. Well then he can, yeah, I don’t know

[17:55] R: There is nothing memorable in this film
JH:  I remember
R: We got done watching all 3 and...I couldn’t remember what the first film we watched was

[19:17] M: And the bad guy is, uh, Robert Patrick, who we all know as the T1000 and he looks like a member of the Backstreet Boys.
Bad guy: Perhaps
JK: I would say—I mean he’s a cross between Joey Fatone and Zachary Taylor Thomas, right in between there
JH: Wait, who?
JK: Both were Backstreet Boys
JH: No
JK I—I—I know a thing or two about Backstreet Boys, right
JH: ZTT was on Home Improvement
M: Yeah, he’s not a Backstreet Boy

[21:22] M: Martial Sharts

[22:09] JH: He turned into Flat Stanley!

[22:26] M: Might as well pull his eyelids back with scotch tape like Rich wanted to do for his Halloween costume [Josh snickers] 
R: What the fuck, Mike? What the fuck?
M: I—I told—I said I wouldn’t tell anyone but I did
JK: Rich—Rich wanted to go as—
R: I can’t win today
JK: He wanted to go as Short Round?

[23:13] M: And why are they brothers? ‘Cause one an Asian, one’s—one’s a Chinaman. Rich?
JH: [Laughs] Goddammit!

[26:01] M: He jumped off a water tower-type thing and said “air mail!”
JH: And then he landed on his face, which wasn’t very effective
M: Like, he threw his body as a weapon—[Postman throws himself off building]

[26:53] JH: Leave an exclamation point, not a question mark
JK: There you go
M: There you go, all right, um...
R: Well, if he jumped off a higher building he would’ve left a lot of escla—es—oh god [Closes eyes]
JH: Don’t, don’t even do it, that one’s not worth it
R: Yeah
M: Go ahead, go ahead
R: If he jumped off a taller building, he would’ve left a lot of ex—
M: The moment’s passed, Rich
[Jack and Josh laugh]
M: No, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were doing it again; try it one more time—
R: Yeah, I’m—fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself—
M: No, no I won’t say anything, I promise
R: What—what am I—what am I, Charlie Brown trying to kick a football here?
M: Try another take of it
R: I’m not gonna fly that kite
M: You guys be quiet, you guys be quiet, try another take of it. Look, I’ll even drink while you’re doing it
JH: You want me to set it up? Leave—leave—leave an exclamation point, not a question mark [Mike grins]
R: Well if he jumped off of a taller building, then he definitely would’ve left some excla—
M: Onto our next film, Deathstalker
JH: I need another drink, I gotta—

[28:08] M: A film with two words that start with D
JK: Yeah
M: And our other films, Deathstalker and Doctor Butcher....are also terrible

[28:48] JK: And for some reason, everyone in this movie, including the hero, rapes. Rape is a sport, rape is a pastime, rape is a reward, rape is a punishment—
M: So it’s like a fraternity? [silence]
JK: Are you saying fraternities get raped or do rapes?
M: Uh—
J: [off-screen] Do rapes! [Laughter is heard in the background] 
M: They do rapes, yeah 
R: It’s like the 1950s song? Do-rape, do-rape, do-rape—
JH: Oh no...
JK: Going to the—
R: [singing] It don’t mean a thing, if you ain’t got that rape. Do-rape, do-rape, do-rape, do-rape, do-rape
JH: Wow, wow—
M: That’s why they call him The Big Bopper? [No reaction from anybody] 

[30:30] [Jack says Deathstalker in a German accent] 

[31:04] M: They look like they’re right out of Troll 2, like they wandered right off the set
JH: But yeah, that actually made sense that they would look like trolls, because, the, uh, the effects were John Carl Buechler, who did Troll, so it’s probably just shit he had laying around (???)
M: Why do you know this guy’s name?
JH: ‘Cause I asked Jay
M: Why does Jay know this guy—ohh!

[31:28] JK: So the goblin stopped the raper from raping the lady, and THEY start raping the lady, only—
[Mike tries not to laugh] 
M: This is Rich Evans’ autobiography? [Zooms in on Rich, he covers his eyes] 
JK: What?  
JH: Which one is Rich Evans? [Jack guffaws] 
R: I’m the one who’s getting raped by my friends
JH: Oh god!
M: Are you calling us goblins? How dare you, sir

[32:30] JK: Because apparently the king was just set up right outside, waiting for the—coitus to be done
R: You don’t know how long it was before he saw the king, there could’ve been dozens of rapes in between then
M: They measure—they measure time and distance in rapes. Six rapes ago, I, uh...
R: In our world we have racehorses, in theirs they have rapehorses [Josh tries not to laugh] 

[38:38] [Rich casually tosses his bottle on the ground, breaking it] 

[40:35] R: I’m gonna be honest with you, I was—I was playing a cellphone game for most of this film

[40:49] [In viewing room] J: Rich, are you playing a game?
M: What are you doing? Cut it out!
J: You gotta pay attention to the film
M: What is the fuck?! ? Take his phone away! This is ridiculous!

[43:12] M: Wait, cannibals are on different sides of the island? 
JH: Yeah, apparently there’s some sort of—I don’t know if there’s like a Donald Trump wall, or something that’s holding them back, but they’re definitely the cannibals that are separated—
R: That is such an east-side-of-the-island cannibal attitude, Josh. You should check your cannibal privilege
JH: I don’t even know what you mean anymore I can’t...

 [44:23] M: The problem was, all 4, 5 people that came to the island were all thin people. They should’ve brought one *really* big fat guy and just like, they could’ve just sat there and studied and they—they all—“we had learned all we can about the cannibals, let’s go.”
JK: They could’ve put him in a cage
R: Word to the wise, if you’re hired to go on an expedition and you’re the only fat guy...
JH: Don’t go
R: Don’t get on the boat
M: We’re talking about you, Louie Anderson [Cuts to a picture of Louie Anderson] Don’t go on the cannibal research expedition
JH: He just wants to cut to a picture of Louie Anderson
JK: Yeah, well, he’s a fat guy...
R: You’re the only one with a bright orange jumpsuit....Louie Anderson, I want to point that out
M: You know if I were a cannibal, and I’m not even one, but I’d still eat you. You’re the other white meat, as they say
JK: But here’s the—here’s the thing, though—
M: Louie Anderson is actually a dish [Chinese restaurant menu shows up with Fat American Pig Meat written under Louie Anderson’s picture, his name is listed under Poultry, oriental music plays] 
JK: When we eat cows, we’re not eating the fat, we’re eating the muscle tissue, you don’t want a Louie Anderson, you want a—
JH: You want like a—like a Terry Crews
JK: You want a Terry Crews, you want an Arnold Schwarzenegger, because the muscle’s what we eat, not the fat! Get it together!
M: You’re right, you’re right
JK: We could use Louie Anderson as a cooking base to cook the muscles—
R: Fat—fat is what makes meat juicy! When you’re looking at a marbled steak, you’re looking at a steak that has more fat in it. The lean steak is tough and it tastes like crap
JK: More fat, but it’s not only fat—we—so—
R: There’s gotta be some—there’s gotta be some non-fat in Louie Anderson—
JK: Here’s what we need—
M: Rich is right—
R: He’s not just a stick of butter!
JK: He’s mostly butter; let’s take a look at Louie Anderson for a minute—
M: Rich knows, he’s buttered up Louie Anderson and licked him [Rich laughs] 
JK: Andre the Giant
R: Andre the Giant
JK: Were—were he still alive, has a nice mixture of fat and muscle—
R: Then that means he’s gone bad by now
M: Yeah, he’s—he’s like a—yeah, the meat’s pretty rotten at this point
JK: We want someone with a lot of muscle, but who’s not too lean, is the problem, so we want a football player
[Pause]
JH: You want, you want like, a Gilbert Brown? 
JK: Like a—well, you know, Gilbert Brown back in the day
JH: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
R: William “The Refrigerator” Perry, he’s probably old, probably a bit tough
JK: Yeah, not as this point, back in the day
JH: See, that’s why I was going for the Gilbert Brown, like, you want...
JK: Gilbert’s still active, but he’s retired....
R: Shaq
JH: Ooh, Shaq
R: Shaq, that’s some delicious meat, Shaq—
M: Shaq would be tasty, yeah...
JH: So on the way back to the relay point they get uh—attacked by the cannibals again and they’re all getting pulled away—
M: [To Rich, Josh continues talking in the background] Lick your lips [Rich does so] Why are you thinking about Shaq? 
JH: And guess what? Once that happens—
M: You want some of that Shaq meat? 
JH: That’s when the zombies come back from the opening of the movie—
M: You want some of that Shaq meat—
JH: Hey! [There’s silence, Jack is downing his glass] I’m trying to talk about the fucking Doctor Butcher, MD
R: Nobody cares
M: Rich—I’m trying to get Rich to lick his lips and say I want some of that Shaq meat [Rich, Jack, and Jay laugh loudly] So I could use it for my own purposes—
JH: I spent my fucking Sunday out here, doing this with you guys...
JK: Mike is working on a gif that will be spread hundreds of millions of times
JH: I don’t—
M: I want that juicy Shaq meat [Jay can be heard laughing in the background] [Cut to clip of Shaq looking scared]

[47:58] M: [To Josh] I need you to say “I want that juicy Shaq meat” 

[48:18] R: [Into microphone] I want that juicy Shaq meat [Everybody except Josh cracks up]
JH: Am I lying, I’m not lying
M: I knew you wanted it! I knew it! I knew it!

[48:36] M: [Whispering] I want that bloody Magic Johnson meat
R: Oh god...
M: I want it raaaaare. I want it rare
R: Look, you’re only having Magic Johnson well done
JH: Can we be done yet? I don’t want to fucking do this anymore

[49:00] JH: The first thing that pops up on every fucking YouTube video from now on, just “I want that juicy Shaq meat”

[50:33] R: [Interrupts Josh explaining the movie] I’m sorry, a few minutes ago, did you say that you wanted some juicy Shaq meat? 
JH: Did I? I don’t believe that I did [Mike covers his face and turns red from laughing]
R: I must have misheard you
JH: You know, Rich—
R: I thought you said that you wanted juicy Shaq meat
JH: Sometimes you just go into your own head, it’s all those magic mushrooms you take, this is why we want you to cut back, not even stop, but cut back
R: I just, I just could’ve sworn I heard you say that you wanted some juicy Shaq meat
JH: No! Did you—were you thinking about, uh, just like caving someone’s face in with the butt of a shotgun again? ‘Cause that happens and I’m a little concerned about that
R: You gotta get to the Shaq meat somehow

[51:50] R: [Turns to the camera] Italians! [Puts two thumbs up]

[52:01] JH: Freeze-frame? [Groans]
R: Fuck you, Italian filmmakers!

[53:08] M: Jack? Best of the worst? What did you enjoy the most?
JK: I don’t like any of these. Um, I—I think we have a cavalcade of garbage. Double Dragon I would like to say is best of the worst but it’s just so bland that I can’t pick it. Uh…Doctor Butcher MD kind of gets a foreign pass ‘cause foreigners made it. I would like to destroy Deathstalker because I was, frankly, insulted by the vast amount of rape that was in it
JH: Fair, but what’s the best?
JK: None
JH: No, you have to pick
JK: The best is this beer I’ve been drinking
M: That’s fair; he doesn’t have to pick a best if he doesn’t want to
JH: Since when?
R: Let me get out the official Best of the Worst rulebook
JH: Please do
M: Wait, I have it here, it’s right here [Reaches under the table, takes out an imaginary book] Oh, it’s nothing! Rich?
JH: I honestly—honestly—honestly, Mike, I thought you were just like, gonna go under here, pull up a couple of these [Holds up middle fingers]
M: Ohh, that too, that too. Rich, your pick for best of the worst?
R: There is only one movie that can be best of the worst….Kazaam
M: I think I know why…
JK: Yeah, dog! [He and Rich high-five]
R: Because it has a genie in it and I wish I hadn’t watched any of these movies
M: Uh, I—I honestly—out of the 3 films that we’re looking at here—
JH: Am I seriously gonna be the only person that votes?
