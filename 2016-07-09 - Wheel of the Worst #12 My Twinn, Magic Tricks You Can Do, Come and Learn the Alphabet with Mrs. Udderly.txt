Mike: Oh! [Jim and Colin are standing silently by the Wheel] Hi! It’s our friends from Canada, Jim and Colin!
Jim and Colin: [In unison] Hi Mike!
[Mike starts drinking again] M: Hi! [They don’t respond] Well, guys, welcome back.Uh...let’s spend our valuable time together watching terrible, terrible VHS tapes
JM: That sounds great!
C: Just like every other time we come down
JM: It is
M: [Makes a face] Our first tape, on the Wheel of the Worst today is called Come and Learn the Alphabet...with Miss--Mizz Udderly...service mark….that’s…that’s wrong
C: What does that mean?
M: Well, a trademark is like a...a--a--is a trade
JM: When something’s successful?
M: No, no, no, a trademark is something that you sell, a product...uh, SM is less frequent, it’s called a service mark, so, meaning, if you want to grab a puppet of a cow and start teaching kids the alphabet, she can sue the fuck out of you
C: What? It’s possible she had it trademarked, but, uh, maybe Ms.Udderly doesn’t know the alphabet very well
M: No-o-o--[Mike laughs, it gradually gets deeper and more demonic-sounding] Uh...I have nothing else to say about this. Jim?
JM: Next film is Message with Siri
M: I believe that says “massage”
JM: Oh. Massage with Siri. Uh, I see some hands and someone standing up against a wall? With a blanket...Interesting
C: [Into his phone] Siri, can you give me a massage?
Siri: Ok, Colin, here is what I found [The cellphone vibrates, Colin uses it to “massage” himself] (?)
M: Oh my god…[Mike looks around] It’s giving him a massage, Siri is...I thought you were making some kind of joke
C: No, why would I do that?
JM: ‘Cause of the video tape
M: Yeah, because the title of the video tape….Our next film...Colin, if--if we can interrupt your massage…
C: Sorry
M:...is this…
C: Kid Escape! from Child Abductors. Uh, “help your children and students learn how to stop kidnappers when they can’t run, shoot…”
M: Oh god...When they can’t shoot back. Your kids--k--are unarmed for that--that--
C: Kid Escape! Uh, it’s from Kid Escape. Uh, that’s a great picture, by the way
M: Yeah
C: It’s funny, like, you guys always joke how, like, the 80s and 90s, people pretty much like, put out VHS tapes about anything. I’m surprised they don’t have “How To Abduct Kids” [Jim snickers, Mike spins the Wheel very slowly]
M: Ouch! Warning: Selling errors are hazardous to your...wealth? Uh….uh….12 minutes in length, that’s all we need to know
JM: It says on the side “we’ve trained 2000 salespeople on action selling.” And it’s a quote by the 3M Company, who made the material for the Star Wars lightsabers
M: Uhh….
JM: 3M material
M: Yeah, they--they make tape
JM: So I hope--
C: Well, post-its
JM: This is kind of like Star Wars
M: I think it ve--very well could be. Colin, what’s our next VHS cassette tape?
C: Wormania! Live worms and song, starring, uh, Billy B., who looks like an asshole, uh, Mary Appelhof, and the Brennan kids! 
JM: Hmm!
C: Um, this looks, right off the bat, without the title, I’m getting like a real bad, like, kind of Christian band vibe from that--
M: Oh!
C: She looks like she’s about to, you know...she’s about to lay down some sick--
M: Some sick beats about Christ?
C: Spit some--spit some hot fire about Jesus
M: Yeah
JM: It says “Live worms and song” so does that mean there’s actually live worms?
C: No, that’s the children, the Brennan kids. 
JM: Ok
C: ‘Cause you can’t look that up online
M: Slip in a Christian message somehow. Slip a worm in your drink….I don’t know what that means, um...clearly, this lady is a loser...Maybe the biggest loser ever. I’m sure that lady has become worm food [Jim snorts] Ironically, I should’ve saved that joke for the discussion...if we watch this, I’m done…Whose talk to turn...whose turn is it now to talk about this film, which--
JM: I think it’s mine
Jay (?): It’s your turn [Mike just drinks his whiskey]
JM (?): Danger Zone!
M: Is this a documentary about Kenny Loggins?
JM: Uhhh…
[Mike rips off the tape, opens it, and removes the cover(?)]
M: Yeah, see...Danger...someone had no idea what they were doing
[Overlapping dialogue]
C: It’s a forklift, it’s coming right at us
M: Pedestrian safety...so we know nothing about its length or its content, other than “pedestrian safety video”
JM: That city’s full of forklifts
M: Oh my god…
[Jim and Colin stare] (?) Idk how to describe this part
M: Jim...you’re next
JM: No, I did the Danger Zone video
C: It’s me, unfortunately...Magic Tricks You Can Do! By magician Doug Anderson, plus, he looks like an asshole, and, uh, this is a really special tape ‘cause it’s actually signed by Doug Anderson. And uh...[Points to the tape] it says here, underneath, see that closeup, it says here: “Awl” A-W-L “D....Best”
M: Oh, “all the best”
C: “D” is for, I guess, Doug
M: Yeah
C: Why would he spell “all” that way? Like the tool way?
M: Uh--”awl the best” maybe it’s his--his--his Texan…
C: Like, his drawl?
M: His drawl?
JM: But that’s--that’s what all m--magicians say, like, once they do the trick, it’s like, “all the best!” 
C: Do they?
M: (?)
JM: Pulling a rabbit out of a hat, “all the best!”
M: I think you’re making this up
JM: I’m not!
M: Well, he already did one magic trick….[Drinks] he can make his audience disappear
[“Magician makes something disappear” joke counter dings once]
M: I certainly hope he’s dead…[Almost laughing] I hope he’s disappeared [The counter strikes a second time] I hope he’s done a trick where he’s turned himself into a skeleton….and all of his flesh and organs vanished [The counter dings a third time]
JM: The D’s for “Doug,” right?
C: Yeah
JM: It’s not--it could be for “do”?
[Mike starts giggling] 
[The camera zooms out, there is no one in the room except for Mike] (Someone else should edit this part so the wording is funnier)
M: [Points to an imaginary person] That’s a good one. Where (???) “all the best”?
[Jim and Colin appear]
JM: All Do Best
M: All Do Best
C: All D Best
M: All Do Best
[They move onto the next tape]
JM: “My Twinn, dolls matching outfits and fun accessories, the one-of-a-kind doll personalized to traumatize your child--”sorry, “personalized to look like your child. Free 7 minute video” so that must be inside the video. Uh, “call 1-800 for a free catalogue, this video may be copied for friends”
C: Oh sweet!
M: Oh ok
JM: And on the side it says “my twinn dolls matching outfits and fun accessories”
C: That’s pretty creepy. So I think, is this like a back-up child in case yours dies?
JM: I mean, they’re not exactly twins, like, massive head, smaller head, uh--
M: And the doll doesn’t have that fucked-up grin [Mike and Colin(?) laugh]
C: Wait, wait--[Points at the girl]--that’s not the doll?
JM: No, it’s a child with encephalitis
C: (?) child taxidermy video [Mike giggles(?)] [Laughing] She’s got--the--the doll--she has more lifeless eyes than the doll

[8:56] M: It’s now time to spin the Wheel of the Worst! Give it a spin, Jim! [He spins it] Oh my god...oh no...it’s My Twinn! [They all clap] I’m so excited. Let’s go watch My Twinn!
[Jim and Colin leave, Mike stumbles around, gets really close to the camera, and heads back to the Wheel]
M: Alright, Colin! It’s time to spin the Wheel. That video sure was great [Pause] Uh huh

[9:54] Rich: “They have no sense of individuality”

[10:00] [Jay points to the TV] J: Creepy

[10:16] R: How many times did somebody get sent the wrong doll? [Colin laughs]
C: And then develop self-esteem issues
R: “I’m not Puerto Rican!”

[10:57] JM: You look way cooler on the box

[11:02] M: Does he have Darth Maul horns? What is on his head?

[11:37] C: There’s nobody behind the camera, that’s why
J: That’s--yeah
C: He set it up on his own
J: Yup, he filmed this in his basement
[Pause]
JM: His parents’ basement

[11:57] [Rich spins the Wheel, it lands on Come and Learn the Alphabet]
R: Fuck my ass! [Walks away]
C: At least we’ll learn the alphabet
JM: Ugghhhh [Blows into his bottle]
[Colin leaves]

[12:21] [The cow starts singing, Colin wheezes]
C (?): “Hi, I’m Mr.Oven Mitt”
[Colin laughs, then Rich starts laughing]
J: Pfff!
M: These are letters…
J: Wow!
M: “Special book”?
JM: I guess ‘cause they’re flying out it’s special?
J: Songs by (???)
M: That’s an SNL skit
[13:42] [At the table] J: Well, this episode was a shitshow and you guys are gonna talk about it now
[Jay sticks his hand through a crowd of empty beer bottles on the table, knocking a few over, and picks up the first tape, Jim laughs]

[14:58] R: The child dresses up like an object
JM: The child is turned--
J: Well, dress up like an object and, uh, learn to become completely obsessed with themselves
JM: Right
R: Yes
JM: The point of--yeah, to make your child ob--or--grow up to become a narcissist
J: I mean, just look at that girl on the front, like she looks like--like a smug little asshole, right? Look at the--look at her cold dead eyes, I think she grew up to the, the woman in the alphabet video
R: Is this like a horror movie? Like does the doll slowly sluck uhs--[Rich looks up at the ceiling in frustration and slams a fist on the table, Jay looks around at the others]
M: That’s staying in
R: Is this like a horror movie? Does the doll slowly just suck away her soul? Like it leeches your humanity away from you and eventually the child becomes, like, the doll?
J: Well, this was, uh, it was--the video slowly sucked away our souls and we weren’t even exposed to the dolls themselves
R: Fortunately, it was only seven minutes long, so--[Jay puts the tape back, using it to push empty bottles of beer off the table]

[17:05] JM: Finally, some quality

[17:33] M: How many products do you have?
JM: But the dogs aren’t twins?.....Right?
M: Ugh...they’ve gone off the rails. The products…
J: They’ve lost focus of their brand
M: A human-puppy hybrid...twin
[At the table]
R: They really half-assed it on those puppies

[18:13] R: This is--this is some f--like, fairly mass producible customization, give them a few options, and they could charge you like, 250 du--bucks for the doll [Money appears on screen, quickly replacing a drawing of some cartoon ducks] (?)

[19:08] R: “She has to be African, now she looks Irish!”
[Colin and Jay laugh]
C: No, it’s like, they actually just get, like, real kids, dip them in this, like, embalming fluid, and like--
R: That’s how they make the dolls?

[25:12] R: “The Lame Escape!”

[26:06] C: Did you ever see, uh, the movie called Hider in the House?
J: No
C: Gary Busey--it’s about a family that moves into a house and Gary Busey lives in the walls
[Silence, Jay laughs]
J: I thought there was more to that, but I guess that’s all you need
C: Well, it’s like, Gary Busey in your walls
J: That would be frightening if--
C: “Hey guys, let’s turn down the air conditionin’, I’m trying to sleep in your walls”
J: Right now Gary Busey IS sleeping in someone’s wall
C: It’s true
R: You have to lure him out with Reese’s Pieces? You gotta try and get Gary Busey back to his home [Rich, Colin, and Jay laugh]
C: You open the closet door and he’s just sort of hiding in your dolls….he’s got these big (?) teeth
R: He falls out of the closet and he’s like “me pee” and he’s just covered in urine. [Laughing] He’s just covered in urine…
C: Aww...he was in a motorcycle accident...they had to rebuild his brain from whatever they had...sawdust...sawdust…
J: Jellybeans?
C: Sawdust and gravel…
J: Yeah
C: A sponge and some peanut butter
JM: Do you want to move on to the next movie?
J: Yes
[After a few seconds of silence, Mike, Rich, Jay, and Colin laugh]

[27:54] C: “Trick you can do”? What? Wait!
J: He fucked up the title of his own video!
[At the table]
J: [Looks at the back of the tape] Oh my god, there’s--wait, wait, there’s a Jesus fish on here
R: What?
C: Is this Christian magic? Would that be actual magic?
R: Well, that would explains why it’s lame

[29:25] Colin and Jay: [In unison] Jesus Christ!
JM: Oh. Oh
J: Jinx
C: That was awkward

[30:29] R: Or maybe--maybe he just started, like, getting dreadlocks, and then he just “nah, this not working”
C: “I’m gonna grow ‘em out, I’m gonna grow ‘em out
JM: Maybe he had cornrows, and it didn’t work
R: Or--yeah, cornrows, not dreadlocks, son of a bitch. I fucked that up. I fuck everything up 

[30:59] R: You know, it’s just the video’s way of letting you down gently. It’s got the elaborate title, then the--then the less elaborate title, and then the fuck-up title

[31:38] J: This is the saddest man…

[32:49] J: They should call the video “How To Impress Idiots”

[33:21] [Rich takes off his cap] R: Oh, FUCK OFF!!!
[At the table] R: It’s obvious what you fucking did, jackass!

[33:35] R: It’s not a trick! It’s not a trick what is blatantly obvious! You dumb fuck!!

[33:52] R: [In a sped-up chipmunk voice] You’re just shaking a pencil!

[35:11] J: “Comedy magician.” He calls himself a “comedy magician”
C: No….Oh my god. He makes the laughter disappear [The “Magician makes something disappear counter” appears again, Rich loses it]

[36:05] J: And that’s where the video got interesting, ‘cause that was just us trying to figure out how he lured this woman into his parents’ basement
C: Yeah, apart from, like, chloroform

[38:48] JM: It landed on his penile code
[Colin and Jay laugh]
R: What? What?
JM: Well, that’s how the trick worked, right?
J: His penile code?
JM: I didn’t say that
J: What did you say?
JM: I don’t know

[42:10] R: You’re a dumb fucking cow

[46:53] J: “Are we fucking done?”
R: “It’s the Necronomicon” 
M: (?)
J(?): “The Special Book was not meant for the world of the living”

[47:41] JM: She kinda looks like a Klingon
C: No, she looks like Kim Cattrall from, uh, Star Trek 6
R: What would a Vulcan children’s show be like?
JM: Are we talking about Valeris?
R: “This is just a puppet, it is not an actual cow”

[48:17] JM: I don’t want to be too mean, but, you know, I kinda said this--
R: It was the makeup, not her
JM: The woman in this--the Roseann woman in this, looks like the--the Devil creature from Legend

[51:03] [Josh replaces Jay, refers to Rich as Mike, Jim as Jack, and Colin as “special guest Max Landis”]

[53:29] R: Hasn’t Doug Anderson had enough in life? I mean really...[Stammers] Every other failure...does he also need to lose on Best of the Worst?
