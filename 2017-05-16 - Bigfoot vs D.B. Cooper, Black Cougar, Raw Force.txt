Jay: Oh my god! It’s our old friend, Len Kabasinski!
Len: Oh, hi…..Jay….[(?) they both look down, Jay is standing on a box, awkward silence follows]
J: [Unconvincingly] Who put that there? [Nobody speaks]
[Best of the Worst intro plays] 
J: Well welcome back to Best of the Worst, Len! Uh, Len, of course, is the director of such films as Swamp Zombies, Curse of the Wolf, and Fist of the Vampire
L: Also, Jay...[Lifts a DVD] My newest film, Angel of Reckoning [Shows off the DVD to the camera then lowers it]
J: Where can people get it?
L: Itunes, Amazon, through the Vudu, uh, video on demand service, and any place better DVDs and movies are sold [Jay nods]
J: Do you just always have that with you?
L:...Um…..yes
J: Well, here is a film I always have with me, it’s our first film of the night, it’s called Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper
L: Who (?)
[Bigfoot vs D.B Cooper title card appears] 
J: We’re gonna go off the assumption that people don’t know who he is, this is D.B. Cooper [Taps the man on the cover] Uh, and he fights Bigfoot. This is a David DeCoteau film, which means if you flip over to the back, it’s the exact same picture just with a bunch of shirtless dudes 
L: Oh
J: Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper starring Eric Roberts and Linnea Quigley, Len! Why don’t you read the back of the box and tell us about this film? [Hands him the tape]
L: My pleasure, Jay [Clears throat] First it says, “exhilarating, entertaining, and fun!” Says Awesome Magazine. “Rachel, a female war veteran returns home, only to launch her own personal vendetta against the criminal underworld when a family member dies mysteriously. The underworld Kingpin rules with an iron fist, and those who are below her are terrified when her name is even mentioned”
J: Wait, Len, are you reading the back of Angel of Reckoning? [Len stares at the DVDs in his hands]
L: Anyways, “Rachel takes on the identity of--A--Angel, a go-go dancer at a popular nightclub--[Jay begins to remove the tape from on top the other tape]--As Angel learns the details of the organization, she begins to-”a--dee--da--duh-- [Jay puts the tape away] 
[Len looks at the Bigfoot tape]
L: “Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper stars Eric Roberts and Linnea Quigley,” and as we can see, “now the truth can be told,” but, have we found Bigfoot? What truth?
J: We haven’t found Bigfoot or D.B. Cooper
L: Would there be to any of--anyways. “When several young hunters arrive at a secluded lodge in the Pacific Northwest, little do they know they will become the hunted”
(...)
[3:27] [Jay puts the Angel of Reckoning DVD back on top of the Bigfoot DVD]
L: “In order to get closer to the inner sanctum, Rachel takes on the identity of Angel, a go-go dancer at a popular nightclub. [Camera focuses on Jay staring off] As Angel learns details about the organization, she begins to exact her revenge on anyone she deems responsible for her family member’s death--” [Voice becomes distorted, camera zooms in on Jay] 

[3:59] Mike: Well, Len, I was not expecting to see that many shirtless dudes in a David DeCoteau film. [Shakes his head] Boy, oh boy. Literally! [Len looks down at the box Mike is standing on] Oh! [Steps down and kicks it away] Who put that there?......This is much better...Now I feel horribly inferior
L: Well, Mike. Let’s clear those images from our mind….Got it?
M: Hmm mhmm
L: What’s up next?
M: Shirtless dudes [Record scratch] Oh. Uh, what? [Shirtless dudes flash on screen for half a second, Mike thinks about a guy in the shower] Uh, how about this? [Picks up the next tape and gives it to Len]
L: Black...Cougar. It’s got a website. Why don’t you tell us about it, Mike? 
M:: Oh, yes, um, I’m very excited about Black Cougar….™. Trademarked it
L: It’s trademarked
M: Uh, this movie is a total mystery. Even though there is a website. Uh, and--and it’s still up, believe it or not, it’s--
L: What would that website be, Mike?
M: It’s printed right here on the back of the box, it’s www dot black cougar dot com. Um, and so, it basically has all the information about the film, there’s some stills, there’s a bunch of text, a synopsis, there’s even a trailer, so, you know, maybe, uh, uh, if you want to know more about Black Cougar, check out black cougar dot com. But let’s talk about the film, let’s start with the top, “finally all children will be safe” [Silence]
L: Frommm…..
M: And--and all children will never be safe
L: From Black Cougar?
M: Black Cougar or no Black Cougar, it’s a very blanketed statement, and then it says “a superhero made for children.” So, this text is very worrisome. It’s very clunky, and very strange, and also it’s--it’s oddly centered, and the title’s down here. There’s a whole lotta weird shit goin’ on here. And there is no pictures of the film on the back
L: There’s the website
M: There is a website, which you should check out, www dot black cougar dot com. There is a picture of New York City, but it’s not actually New York City, it’s actually Las Vegas, it’s the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. So I don’t know if whoever made this is--is...mentally challenged or strange--
L: So what you’re saying is that it’s set in Las Vegas
M: Um--uh--it’s possible it’s set at the New York-New York Casino in Las Vegas. “While the city sleeps, Black Cougar protects”
L: So we’ve established that now, that he’s the superhero that’s protecting children from something bad is Black Cougar
M: Well it doesn’t quite say what he’s protecting, it just says he protects. Um--[Len looks at the cover]
L: “All children will be safe”
M: “All children will be safe,” that may be an unrelated sentence
L: I got it, I got it, I got it
M: “Silvio….local teenager…”
L: This isn’t American
M: No, uh, “befriends neighborhood children,” period. “When he prevents a tragedy from occurring--”
L: I don’t like where this is going at all
M: “He finds himself confused when questioned”
L: Or confused now
M: Yeah. “He confronts his father, only to be pacified,” oh my god, this is so Asian [Gong rings] “When a plague of kidnappings hits the neighborhood, it’s Silvio who’s accused. Now it’s the father’s time to tell Silvio the secret. They come together to find out who’s involved.” ...That’s a sentence
J: [In the background, laughing] What is happening?
M: I don’t know. “What they find out is a little more than what they bargained for. Father and son now come together to take on evil”
L: I have no idea what you’re talking about
M: Uh--uh--there’s no mention of Black Cougar whatsoever--
L: It’s Silvio
M: Silvio and his father are...doing somethin’
L: So his father or Silvio could be the Black Cougar
M: Oh my god, the--the director is named Silvio [Jay laughs] This is getting worse
L: So we have established what, exactly?
M: Uhh, there’s a lot of kids in danger in Las Vegas casinos. Well, it’s time to find out what Black Cougar’s all about [Brief silence] And don’t forget to check out that website www dot black cougar dot com
L: [Points to the camera] Black cougar
M: For information about the film
L: Dot com

[8:21] Jack: Hey Len! What’s our next, uh, movie?
L: Our next movie is...[Holds up the tape towards the camera] Raw Force
[Raw Force title card appears]
[In the screening room] 
JK: RAW FOOOORCE! Yes!
(?): The shuriken, the ninja star--
[In the VHS room]
L: I’m gonna read this for you ‘cause I am very excited to watch...this again
JK: [Mouths] Okay
L: Okay. “Welcome to Warrior Island burial ground of disgraced martial arts masters.” I think that’s really all I need to read, but um--I’ll--I’ll continue
JK: An island full of martial arts masters who are also bad guys
L: They’re also disgraced
JK: Well--tha--ba--[Freezes, DISGRACED appears on screen] 
L: “When the Burbank Kung Fu Club…[Nods] that’s right [Chuckles] The Burbank Kung Fu Club
JK: Burbank’s known for, you know, a couple things...
L: Disgraced martial arts masters?
JK: And great crepes
L:...What are crepes? [DISGRACED appears] 
JK: The--they’re like a--they’re like a--very thin pancakes [DISGRACED appears again] 
L: I’m gonna continue here, “when the Burbank Kung Fu Club travels to the mysterious island,” we established that’s Warriors Island, “they quickly find themselves facing the bloodthirsty vengeance of flesh-ripping kung fu-fighting zombies--” Yes!

[10:00] [In the screening room]
L: Someone take the gun from Cameron Mitchell
[In the VHS room]
JK: Are you telling me we’re gonna have kung fu and zombies?
L: [Nods] Hmm mhm
JK: This sounds like an awesome movie
L: It’s, pffff….wait. “Gun-toting while(?) slave traders and a band of strange monks……”
JK: Okay
L: “Who may be the only key to explaining the madness.” They have you follow the madness (?)
JK: There’s monks, there’s guns, there’s zombies, there’s kung fu, and there’s Burbank, I’m with you
L: The Burbank Kung Fu Club
JK: Of course
(...)
L: “Edward Murphy’s Raw Force is a visual smorgasbord of over-the-top sleaze. [Counts on his fingers] Mixing zombies, cannibals, outrageous action…”
JK: Hmm mhm
L: “...gore…”
JK: HMM hmm
L: “...copious amounts of nudity
JK: Shit dawg 
L: “Starring exploitation greats Cameron Mitchell and Vic Diaz,” we’re gonna put two up for that, “and kung fu”
JK: Boom! 
L: Pow!
JK: Sh-pow! Well, Len, cannibals, zombies, guns, action, boobs, Cameron Mitchell--uuu--this is like the greatest movie ever made
L: [To the camera] We’re about to find out
JK: Let’s go watch it
[Rich walks in]
Rich: Oh [Bends over to pick up the box]
L: What the?
R: There’s my crate [Leaves]
JK: Oh, okay. That wrapped that up real nicely

[12:15] JK: When the chair size goes up the entertainment factor goes down, you know
M: Well, everybody...uh, o--our friend Len Kabasinski is back on Best of the Worst, and--and in celebration of enjoying three wonderful films--[Holds up a bottle of sake, Jack raises his glass]--we’re gonna, uh, well--you put that down--
JK: Oh
M: We’re gonna have a shot of sake. Um--
JK: Say goodbye to your eyesight, everyone
M: And Rich--Rich, since he had a little problem with alcohol before that resulted in...some unintentional deaths...uh, Rich doesn’t drink alcohol, but Jack, Len, and I will [Mr. Booze plays, they clink shot glasses] Cheers!
L: Ninja sake 
R: You’re spilling 5 hour energy all over the--this is, this is T’Hofful [They drink]
JK: Ugh, that tastes horrible [Len rubs his hands together]
L: Woo! That is...poopy [Jack laughs] That i--ninja sake
JK: Oh, that does not come into the night silently
L: Woo!
JK: No
M: [Holds up the Bigfoot case] Rich--Rich blew his load all over Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper, and boy oh boy, is that ironic

[15:14] R: Oh, ffff...fuck off [Everyone laughs] 
JK: Isn’t this amazing, Rich?
M: It’s amazing how...how blatant a--eh--lazy it is [Others agree]
L: Lazy’s a good word for it [Rich sighs]
[Cuts to later]
M: They’re still running, I knew this was gonna happen 

[16:10] M: It’s a literal run time

[19:34] M: I would say a good entire third of the movie in the middle, is one guy after the other coming up the staircase, individually going to a different room in the house, removing their pants, and standing in front of the mirror with the gun
[Guy goes down the hall pantless and carrying a gun]
[In the screening room]
JK: Here it is
J: Alright
JK: Here it is
J: The moment of truth
JK: Come on, be done, be done, be done, be done, rule of threes, rule of threes, rule of threes. Rules apply in our real world...[Another guy goes upstairs] Nooo! [Jay and Rich laugh] Noooo! Noooo! NOOOOOO! [Mike claps]
J: This one can’t even take his shirt off. It’s already gone
JK: Ughhhh shit
M: But the pants are comin’ off, it’s about the pants!
JK: Come on!!!

[20:43] R: I swear to God I have a feeling David DeCoteau just met 5 dudes at a--at a gay bar…
L: Right [Mike widens his eyes]
R: And they just hang out--hung out that weekend
L: Well, two of them had to be, like, personal friends, ‘cause they weren’t ripped or anything

[23:37] M: D.B. Cooper plot is one, his--his Vietnam buddy...slash, um, uh, co-conspirator…
R: Yeah
M: Is a plot point in itself, five guys staying at the house is one
R: Okay
M: And the existence of Bigfoot is the other
R: Yeah
M: Other than that there is no other, like, meat to the movie
R: No
JK: Right
M: No pun intended
L: It was four, I didn’t really notice--
JK: Oh. Oh, there’s plenty of meat to the movie
R: Plenty of...beefcake?
JK: Yeaahhh dog
[Mike stares at Rich with a disappointed expression]
R: What? [Jack mumbles]..........Fuck off
JK: Man meat
[Silence] 
L: [Grabs his glass] Well, I’m out, so--

[24:34] R: Is that the guy who voices, uh.....Frank West in Dead Rising?
J: I’m gonna say no. I don’t even know what you’re talking about but I’m gonna say no
[They go to Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper’s IMDB page, check the actor’s page and confirms Rich’s statement, freezes and zooms in on Rich’s face, EPIC WIN!!! appears on screen] 

[25:52] M: Well, that was the worst film I’ve ever seen…
R: You always say that, I think it’s finally true
M: Yeah
JK: Yeah!
R: This is the worst film we have ever done
JK: Ever
M: ‘Cause it’s barely a film
R: It’s arguable if it actually is a film. [Turns to the camera] For once this is not Mike Stoklasa hyperbole, this is...the...worst…
JK: Worst thing…
R:...film we have ever watched! This is the first time I have ever sat down with some dudes and watched a gay porno and…[Mike laughs] it was--it was very uncomfortable 
M: Wait, wasn’t there that time that the guy invited you into his bedroom to show you his Wendy’s ad?
[Silence]
L: Where’s the beef?
M: Heh--and he said “show me the beef”? [Jack laughs quietly] 
R: I hate you so much
M: Remember? And he closed the door behind you?
JK: He wanted to show you his Warhammer figures
R: I--I hate you so much
M: His Warhammer “figure,” singular 
JK: Yeah
L: Somebody, somewhere at that end--[Jay puts the Bigfoot DVD case that Rich threw on the ground earlier back on the table]--had the idea to turn…[Rich throws the case on the ground, Jack laughs] D.B. into Bigfoot, and um…
JK: No, we….
M: Yeah, I don’t think we can say much more about D.B. Cooper...
JK: That was fine--that was a fine discussion about a gay porno, great! [Jay puts the case back, Rich throws the tape on the ground] Cross that off my bucket list--[Laughs]
M: D.B. Cooper does not deserve to be on this fucking table! [Jack laughs] The amount of trash that has sat on this table…
L: Yeah
[Mike looks at the Angel of Reckoning case sitting on the table]
M: Oh [Removes the case, Rich guffaws] D.B. Cooper and that movie...do not deserve to be on this table! [Rich laughs]
L: Kind of a nut punch, but okay 

[28:57] M: [Whispers] This is embarrassing 

[31:13] [A kid flips off one of his kidnappers, everyone exclaims]
L: Sooo New York 

[33:22] J: “Welcome to my secret stainless steel kitchen” 

[35:30] JK: So there are  Arabs, there are black dudes, there are Jersey people, there are--
R: You’re awful focused on race, Jack
JK: Jersey people are not a race!...And--and there are--there are breakdancers--
L: Breakdancers
JK:--and there are all these villainous people around the table, and--
R: Why are you racist against breakdancers? 
L: Yeah, what’s wrong with breakdancers?
JK: How do they get their bodies to move like that, it’s unnatural! 

[40:57] JK: I could put a lot of effort into building a rocket, at the end of the day it would still explode 
[Picture of Kim Jong Un appears]
[Mike swings his bottle around while it’s still in his mouth (?)] 
R: You’re giving yourself that much credit that it would even explode? [Mike sets down the bottle and nearly laughs] And it wouldn’t just be a pile of junk sitting in your driveway?

[42:26] M: He looks like the guy from Spinal Tap, Christopher Guest
JK: Yeah
M: From Spinal  Tap or the singer of Iron Maiden…
L: So you’re saying people with long hair are freaks, well--what I’m gonna do--[Starts to remove his mic]--fuck--fuck this. Here’s your microphone…
JK: There’s something wrong with them
M: People with long hair…
JK: That hair gets in the way
L: Fuck you guys--[Gets up]--I’m gonna go get another drink…(?) [Leaves] 
R: We tore his movies Skull Forest like a fucking new one and ripped on him for like a solid hour, and yet talking about his hair is what did it [Jack laughs] That’s what crossed the line

[44:50] M: The weird thing is that his website is still up…uh, blackcougar.com
JK: I spent hours on blackcougar.com, I--I--I’m looking for like the documentary on making of Black Cougar--
L: And you did not find that
JK: I mean, like, I searched, just...I need a new credit card

[45:25] M: Len Kabasinski…[Len punches the air] from KillerWolf Films
JK: Dot com
M: Dot com, creator of such hit films as Swamp Zombies…..[Jack leans over and whispers]
JK: Curse of the Wolf
M: Curse of the Wolf, Ninja: Prophecy of Death
R: Fist of the Vampire
M: Fist of the Vampire…
L: Now, Jay, you haven’t listed out(?) your favorite movie! 
J: [In the background] Fist of the Vampire
L: Fist of the Vampire!
M: Apocalypse of the Female Warrior--
L: It’s close…
M:--Vampires
L: It’s--it’s…
M: Buncha other shit! [Rich laughs] Len! Tell us all about...Rrrrraw Force--[Holds the s sound]
L: Raw Force...and, uh, for the viewers, I’ve seen Raw Force--
R: Mike, you made Space Cop
JK: [Whispers] And a bunch of other shit
M: Hey!....Space Cop is the number one film in Uganda
[Cuts to a video of Ugandan men talking]
Man: Wisconsin is famous for snow and the...Space Cops
Other man: I know which--
Man: Space Cop is the best movie ever made [Rich and Jack laugh] It is so fantastic. Everyone in da world knows that movie 
L: I have seen Raw Force, you guys have not
M: And ironically, Raw Force is not a porno
L: No. There’s no--[Rich laughs, Jack laughs and holds his head in his hand] There are, wait! There are two shirtless men in the movie, I think? So it’s the anti...Bigfoot vs D.B. Cooper. Right?
JK: I had something in my mouth and I was laughing and I didn’t wanna spill it all over my face 
[Silence]
L: Okay
R: [Turns to the camera] Booze, folks!
[Silence]
M: Rich, ho--how do you do it?
R: Without booze?
M: How do you not--how do you be sober?
[Plays montage of Mike, Len, and Jack drinking] 

[50:03] R: It moved, every, every minute of the film went with something new
JK: And if the plot wasn’t moving, we’d see boobs and bush
R: Now we’re at a whorehouse, now we’re on a boat, now we’re at a weird, wild sex party on a boat, now…[Jack laughs] Now pirates are invading and a guy with a Nazi hat is trying to rape a woman who is turned on by weird things!
M: (?), Rich
R: And now the boat’s blew up, we’re on an island! Now the island has cannibal monks! Now we’re being chased by zombie monks(?)
JK: Don’t forget the island has prostitutes, nudity, nudity, nudity! Well, so--
M: Raw Force is Citizen Kane compared to…
R: [Into his mic] Mike is so drunk right now
[Brief silence]
JK: It’s the difference between--
M: I could hear you, you little shit

[51:29] JK: Can we just take a moment to mention the weird, bearded baby bartender?
L: That guy…
M: Proto-hipster?
(...)
M: He looks like Bozo, but paler
