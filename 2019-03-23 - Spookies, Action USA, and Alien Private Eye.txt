well rich we're back and I was thinking
we could maybe do something just a
little bit different today oh that's
perfect Jeff because I've been spending
a lot of time on Facebook lately and I'd
like to have an in-depth personal
discussion with you today about why your
children shouldn't get vex we're gonna
do a battle of the genres what were you
saying about anti-vaccination oh you see
shouldn't give your kid rich it's been a
while since we've done a battle of the
genres in the early days of the show I
think we did them because we would do
like themed episode yeah where we
watched all dinosaur movies or like all
ninja movies and that was far too
redundant we decided that we wanted some
more varieties so we started battle of
genres and now every episode is kind of
a battle of the genres what we're gonna
do one now with the official rules which
are it's different somehow
I think we I think I think the idea is
instead of voting best of the worst we
vote which is the best representation of
its genre okay we've got an action
horror and sci-fi
oh the Spooky's we got a classic 80s
cover here a lot of different monsters
the Spooky's imagine you and your
friends are paired up with your favorite
dates and the night is very young okay
there's an old dilapidated mansion just
down the road event near the deserted
graveyard it would be the perfect place
to party
let loose lose your souls what you and
your friends don't know is that inside
the house lives an ancient sorcerer a
master of the dark arts he has
sacrificed many to give eternal life to
his beloved comatose bride just a few
more humans are needed the masterful
wizard is about to begin another evening
of magic conjuring up the dizzying array
of monstrous creatures hellish lizards
skeletal Reapers demons zombies ghosts
lust crazed muckman lost crazed madman
why isn't that the title of the roofie
luring hags and spider-woman well
alluring hags are luery I think that
meant alluring but it just says luring
okay so it says you just have a little
hag in the corner going come here I got
some mutton nothing you have ever
witnessed before will it prepared you
for the incredible special effects that
make Spooky's the ultimate unforgettable
experience in pure unrelenting terror
that was a whole lot of text just to say
it's some kids go into a house and see
monsters
yeah he's a pirate gypsy cat werewolves
a sound effect
oh oh he's the hardy one that heart
heart our next film with an amazing
cover in a very direct title is action
USA now in the Battle of the genres is
that our action film no no this is our
science fiction films okay okay
because the car is flying so I assume
it's set in the future and this guy is
also flying Billy Ray's a bad risk he
took the mobs family jewels now they
want this now the one is rich they when
his family jewels they tried beating and
scaring it out of him but he's not
giving them up so they kill him now
everyone believes Carmen must know where
the jewels are who's Carmen they didn't
introduce Carmen Carmen gets halfway
through the movie Jay the mafia boss has
brought in his top gun in all caps no
registered trademark after Top Gun
though to find her and the jewels the
slimeball and his trained killers follow
our heroes through car crashes and gun
battles across the state of Texas
leaving a trail of fireballs and hunks
of twisted metal who are heroes there's
only a girl who's on the run is Carmen
the girl I thought so Carmen is in
possession of the family jewels this was
an action hero who took the jewels but
he apparently dies early in the film but
she taking the corpse with her I don't
know
action USA I can't wait I want some luck
we got a we got explosions yeah the guy
falling out a window
we got fast cars oh that's gotta be the
family jewel and an animated family
jewel looks like it's from a fantasy
film I'll be so happy if like they
didn't even have like a fake jewel to
use so they have an animated
you'll and it's like Who Framed Roger
Rabbit but he's just the jewel yeah the
whole movie he like picks it up and they
awkwardly trying to animate it in his
hand
Richard leaving and I just discovered
very important information Cameron
Mitchell is in the spell I repeat
Cameron Mitchell is in action USA yes no
big deal let me tell you you lousy
diamonds I'll tell you what he's making
her air yeah I like you you're my
security hair see he needed his
emotional support hair Rosie gets really
cranky
yes jumpy please so what what are you
jumpy looks like them Duke boys are in a
bunch of trouble again oh he doesn't
have the magic jumping abilities all
their bad guys are dead now those oh my
god of course
so our final film I presume our science
fiction film is alien Private Eye I
don't even say anything else the cover
is so embarrassing everything it's got
non-stop action and an out-of-focus
alien Private Eye on the cover yeah that
looks like he was in that looks like he
was in the background of a larger photo
and then they just like zoomed in on him
so that's why he's not a focus maybe
he's not that maybe he's just like an
extra but they thought he looked
interesting enough to be on the box
baby's not actually about an alien
Private Eye Nicky he'll star of radon
all-time classic action extravaganza
game of survival is that the full title
of the film it's who are these people
and what is this IV radon is the person
who made game of survival but I am not
familiar with either of these things
isn't right on a video game character
radon is something you have to be
careful isn't in your home's basement or
your guys triumphantly returned Nikki
Hill you know from the memorable game of
survival
so some random actress that was in some
random movie triumphantly returns as LEM
role a stylish Private Eye with a nose
for action our story takes place in Los
Angeles because it's convenient because
that's where all the movies are filmed
where two halves of a magical black disc
have been hidden rumors of its power
have spread throughout the underworld
every two-bit thief petty criminal
dreams of finding both halves and
claiming the disks power for themselves
Oh black disc nonstop action gang wars
car chases and sexy love scenes are just
some of the fun leading up to the final
don't drag them out confrontation where
LEM rose through powers I revealed but
enough said we read a babe find out
yourself is that what it says it says
eaten upset it says well it smells
enough wrong it doesn't do enough like
Stanley if throws an e in front of it
but it's still not spelled like enough
but it does say runt the tease and find
out for yourself I've said read the tape
and find out for yourself
so they didn't even have enough
confidence in this film that anyone
would ever want to buy it legs gonna nip
on some shelf just 1 million space bucks
this feels like like like the producers
oh yeah like they just don't care
I actually forgot we were doing battle
of the genres yeah I was just thinking
about it like a regular episode
basically it's a regular episode except
for like the two seconds at the end
which is usually about a five minute
discussion that we trimmed down to two
seconds because it's never interesting
and never so basically it's a waste of
time to call this battle of the genres
but we're gonna do it anyway if we can't
have pointless rules that we don't
understand ourselves well and that we
don't follow completely ignore most
let's always forget about that's fine
you know what it's fine
so I am sitting near the middle and you
are a rookie so I'm gonna stick tape I'm
gonna take charge and I already
mispronounced some you're gonna take
charge I'm gonna stick charge yeah prime
rib eye rich if you do the intros who's
going to explain alien Private Eye I I
guess that's up to you but I don't know
that I have the power you like you like
spoopy movies booby earthen Scoobies
spoopy is the movie starring Scoobies
this is Spooky's this is a movie I've
heard about for years and I never seen
famously as famous and as anything
related to Spooky's is the movie was
shots and then the producer saw it and
they said this sucks
we need more spoopy things and so they
went back to do reshoots but they didn't
have the original actors so they just
shot unrelated shit that they tried to
kind of shoehorn into the movie and it
feels like a movie that they shot
unrelated shit and shoved into its full
cavils mustache where you can yes
clearly tell this is the Justice League
of B schlock horror films yeah the movie
starts with a little kid we don't know
who he is or why he's there but he goes
to the woods and meets a child molester
yeah that's under a tree first to eat or
celebrate something well that's the best
place to go to attract child monsters
well it's it's the most like if you want
to go by the molesting tree bring some
snowballs to share know what's going on
though we're randomly cut cutting away
to two groups of people and do different
cars that are following each other and
it's very confusing
what a jerk just so down do you know we
doesn't know these roads like you do I
do know these roads don't you
and we're done with that
what the fuck is going on
yeah well those two cars they were at a party together
but one is like young like like hip kids
"I'm an asshole man, I'm gonna drink, do what I want"
and then the other car is like like old man
we thought it was like the designated
driver or something but like the
chaperone the father a chaperone but no
it's one of those kids boyfriend's
someone was dating Uncle Tony well
that's yeah so we cut to two cars
driving to somewhere okay back to Billy
back to cars back to Billy who shows up
at an abandoned house and in front of
totally real graveyard yes yes so he
goes into this run-down abandoned house
and there is a creepy birthday party
waiting for him there hey surprise party
so you didn't forget after all this must
be your house why are you here what are
you doing he just went into a random
house the party's for you yeah what's
happening why is he there yes this
blocks it and he starts talking to it's
like oh you did this for me yeah okay
come on oh I walked into this abandoned
house and I'm not surprised at all that
there's a birthday party specifically
for me here
yeah and then we see our second spooky
who's dressed up like a Jawa yes the
makeup was so bad we thought it was like
the school bully who was about to play a
prank on Bobby we thought it was a
little kid in a Halloween costume or
something that's exactly in the context
of the movie yes in reality it's a
little kid in the Halloween costume yeah
but I mean it really doesn't matter
because that particular spooky does not
show up for another hour yeah
happy birthday Billy he gets spooked out
by by dr. spooky law we got to talk
about dr. Acula
every newsie who's every Abraham
sometimes sometimes who's the ringleader
of this whole affair what is clearly
reshoots that had nothing to do with the
original movie and all of the pawns have
been sacrificed
valina Queen back again just just to be
clear the original movie before reshoots
is very obvious which is a bunch of kids
go to a house abandoned house to party
find in a Ouija board and conjure up
spirits and then go from room to room
being boring and occasionally a spooky
jumps out it's the original movie
involved luring Evil Dead but you can
tell what it is and and what the
original plot was supposed to be before
the reshoots kind of like try to
recontextualize everything and add
nothing to the story yeah like they pull
out the Ouija board and then we cut to
dr. Acula
and it's like he's controlling the Ouija
board now
and he's controlling the Ouija board so
he can kill people to collect souls to
bring his dead wife back to life even
though she is already back to life he
was just sleeping well and and he needs
to kill them to collect their souls
but also he just enjoys fucking with them
yeah
I'm so glad they added these reshoots to make the movie just a little more clear
come on, meegan, it's spooky as hell inside
oh did he go and pick them up
oh I guess they have two cars
oh fuck it
wait, Billy's back
oh good
pay attention
because that's what
happens to Billy in this film is
he gets clawed slightly and falls into an open grave
and then I guess he's just too tired to climb out
yeah well it is very
wolf dude was fast
really yeah Billy every once it all
kinda goes he's allergic to dirt so
Billy's out of the movie and our group
of teens and Uncle Tony come to the
house somebody they want a party cuz
they got kicked out of the party for
fighting for Rocco what was his name
yes Rocco trash bag man I'm surprised
nobody got into a fight with the the guy
with the puppet like if anyone's gonna
get beat up at a party it's a guy with a
puppet Oh dunks mad now MOOC that was
another thing about this movie
it's like introduced many characters
where you I hope to like people unless
they're just like Oh obviously you're
the villain
we shouldn't like you but it's just like
okay I'm behind this Billy kid because
he's got a snack lunch well no but it's
like
but then you're just like okay oh, god, fucking die
and now the joke guy and his friend, mook
it's like okay enough of you kill this man
i'm in control
i'm in control
it's okay
oh, fuck you
have you guys have been on an airplane
and then there was a grandma
boyfriend of course or a boyfriend yeah
spoiler alert who's the hero of the
movie somehow well the hero of the
original and until eight till they re
edited the film to make them all just
die spoilers so Spooky's very bad
obviously very bad movie shockingly
interesting creatures yeah like they're
not great special effects but they're
enough where you're like oh they tried
but fun it's cool ya know sometimes and
except for when they got back to that fucking wolf man
fuck that guy
why can
you can somebody explain to me why we
cut away to the wolf man so much it's
like they have to have a shot of him in
between every other shot of the film why
he goes up to windows and looks in at
the scene that's happening that has
nothing to do with him and these keep
looking in the window like their shafts
like you know in the original movie that
these doors just like closed on their
own and that was supposed to be spooky
but they chose the edit this so that
Wolfman is the one closing all of the
doors
maybe that's his job maybe the editor
also played the Wolfman and you just
wanted to get as much fish the one that
we all fell in love with immediately and
when they got injured we're like ah
that's spooky
we felt it's like don't worry just stab
that the sperm lizards than we did for
any of that all what your sperm looks
like but we're cool looking at little
gnarly teeth weird little eyes and we
said they but it's clearly just one
because he never said boy you haven't
wanted a shot in time but it supposed to
be like a room full of them attacking
her I want to say one of the okay so the
first creature we see is like the
soliton the first spooky very first one
we see is when their friend Carol gets
possessed that's the first one we see
and then she wants to kill everybody
because in the original movie she is the
head villain the demon that possesses
the girl yes but now I guess she's just
a pawn because it's dr. Acula in charge
whatever speeding through yeah
but then we get the horny mud monsters
horny is something but I was told of the
back of the box that they're horny
yes the next thing we see is the horny mud monsters that aren't horny but they do fart a lot
they emerge from the ground
it's just like wait a minute
was that a--
holy shit it was
are these the horny--
not lusty
gusty
gusty
is this like in editing they just said fuck it
it has to be
they're shitty minors
fuck it
it has to be
and those things were violent
one definitely was
I mean, one just was just like this table is done
just like smacking down support posts and, holy shit, calm down
when you said they were violent I thought you
were just talking about the potency of their farts
wine
the wine barrels
what
stop them from farting
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
I'm going to suggest that maybe just some really terrible sound editing thought that was a good squishy sound effect for muck monsters
i'm gonna go ahead and disagree with you
you ever step in like a bucket of muck
it sounds like a fucking fart
just put a fart in
it's like those little things that you squish your fingers in
my kid just got some gak
what is gak?
gak is great stuff
oozy
gak is stretchy
it's the thing that got the movie banned
from theaters kids would just come out
just annoyed the rest of the mall took
my children to cease poopies and little
Timmy just kept farting on a sister
afterwards I couldn't get his little
sister Halloween in 1987 every kid just
wanted to go as a fart monster kids
across America farting on their parents
I love that this is the most movies is
what they would have called like the
Saturday morning cartoon adaptation yes
yes the real spoopy okay so what is our
next spooky Asian lady turns into a fucking spider
yes
oh
okay
head's getting bigger
that's fucking weird
what the fuck is gonna come out of that
ooh, ooh, maybe
oh, yeah, yeah
yeah, she's turning into a spider
here we go
yeah
yeah
oh, my god
that's horrifying
oh, god
that's awesome
I don't know what happened
I kind of assumed the whole movie would be the little little slug monsters like though when I think of
Spooky's I think of Ghoulies you think
of those type of movies so you just have
a bunch of little creatures running
around but this is just like whatever
like well we make this movie it's
terrible
let's fix it let's add some more things
to it oh my god it's still terrible yeah
they're writing out the success of mangy
so our next spooky is the grim reaper
he shows up
a statue that comes to life
our werecats closes the door
clearly the werecat
he's always fucking closing those doors
he's the anti Cameron Mitchell
no he's the ultimate he's like Cameron Mitchell's like ultimate like henchman
yes
close those fucking doors 
he always closes the fucking doors
i love that wolfman
would you close the fucking doors
close that fucking door
yes cameron
i'll close the fucking door
just stop yelling at me
cameron Mitchell should have been dr. Acula
that would have been great that would
have elevated this probably to the best
movie I've ever seen and so they're
trapped in this room and and they can't
open the door and so our our hero Uncle
Tony decides to do the only logical
thing
diving headfirst through a door
that was great
that was great
I've seen windows
but not doors
jack, it fucking worked
yes
cuz dude Rocko tried many chairs
rocko has never opened a door in his life he
has no idea how to do it I just throw
chairs at him they open up I don't know
but they still have to deal with the
Grim Reaper that's chasing oh yes I'm
sorry
combustible if you throw death off a
roof he did it so effortlessly take that
death it was a grim reaper made out of kerosene because that bitch went up
the Grim Reaper it's a little bit of
trivia the Grim Reaper prop was
originally supposed to appear in action
USA we load everything with Grim
Reaper's so the truck for this explosion
scene it's filled with Grim Reaper's
truck is it just giving you a gaucho in
action USA that explosion that was too
big I had it too many Reapers
well this is this is eighty minutes into
the movie where we are now introduced to
our protagonists his his reborn wife
knifes in my head my only weakness rod
puppet arms who has to fight madam yeah
remember though the old puppet Alyssa we
see those we see the hand of the
puppeteer many many to the point where
you wondering if it's intentional it's
uh you know what it's a ghost puppeteer
okay controlling the witch puppies the
spirit of Jim Henson's and then she has
to run away and then she runs from
zombies
knocking fifteen minutes a little like
ugly baby who's like Baba
all right okay I'm super into it so so
then she dies all of our other heroes
died Billy's dead everybody dies
exist
so our next movie is action us a Tim
would you like to tell everybody about
this fine film I'll tell you about the
film action USA is all about diamond
smuggling you think diamond smuggling
would need more of a cat burglar type
touch to it look new you go balls-out
action car chases bang bang bang through
glass titties it in here yeah cool buses
cool buses you know what's not in there
cleverness when you have blunt stupidity
and where's the where's the people
moving the china plate made of glass yes
little corner fruits they all got a
ladder well it starts with lovers just
lovers and the guys being all coy and
stuff and he's like oh yeah it's gonna
be nice
over overcompensation of incumbency oh
oh yeah you know what I forgot about the
entire opening in this movie it's
beautiful Corvette
for his penis smallest micro penis I
would think you're in a driveway ladies
wanna see my movie oh my god how could
you see oh my god his dick is so small
the movie equivalent of the guy who has
the nice car yes this is the filmmakers
compensating yeah he's feeling up a lady
while drinking and driving in a sports
car in Texas he needs to be eating a
steak he's gonna pull a steak out from
her thighs yeah goat walks out of course
dude is packing he really got a good
also he has a gun he's had a gun this
whole time it's so small and that goes
to the first door being blown in that
there are just like it's just like it's
not even on hinges it just kind of gets
knocked over our two first favorite hit
men jacked up Freddie Mercury to finish
Mercury dig the shit's elusive he gets
put small penis gets put in the trunk of
a car and taken to like a bridge mm-hmm
she gets in her car to chase after
knowing exactly where he goes cuz that
starts the theme of there being only one
road in Texas everybody knows where
everybody else is at every moment at
every moment they get into a helicopter
so they can intimidate micropenis into
telling them where the diamonds are well
I was surprised you see that
helicopter-like going through like a
town square I guess I got a low to the
ground like it's yeah baby easy I'll
criticize this movie about a lot of
things but that was impressive ya know
all the all the stunts and explosions and all the shit in this movie like which is the reason the movie exists like oh that stuff's great
it's it is it
always great I'm gonna well most of its
good okay okay it's great except for
winner it isn't for a movie called
action USA it lives up to it like
there's enough action I think I don't
think there is I think it's just there's
a few well-timed explosions and some
kind of mediocre action I said it I said
personal aim shootouts I mean there's
some lame chases but they all end in
spectacular explosions I'm not expecting
John wick the raid level constant
excitement from a movie called
action USA
yeah
I want to see stupid shit and
you see a lot of stupid shit yeah when
they drop him out of a helicopter on
accident we should have known by his car
so he goes into the water
lady knows where he landed
what happened to you
get the fuck over, dammit
he's like get out of the driver's seat bitch
thanks for picking me up
i'm driving
peels out
instead of being bright, using the helicopter to like like pursue
yes
and be on top of this car now they'll land and take the time to land and get into their own car to follow
no it's not their car
they steal someone's car
oh, they steal somebody's car
which continues, like this action sequence has been
happening for the last 10 minutes
yes
and it's a wily coyote bullshit mess
and it's great because they're everywhere there's explosions there's cars this crashes
Oh God
how did that happen he turned a corner
in the door that's a guy a wig this is
oh this is the one where there's a
school bus possibly stopped at a
railroad crossing yes yeah call back you
got to be careful at those railroad
crossings and they see a tow truck and
the dude wants to take it as a ramp this
this actually is a good piece of
foreshadowing
because later in the movie girl who ends
up surviving is clearly concussed it's
clear yeah it's clearly not the writing
of somebody that doesn't understand how
to write a female character with any
sort of motivation at all or any sort of
logical human being yeah the bad guys
kill the dude but before they kill the
micropenis he gives some vague clues for
something we don't really know about yes
and here's where I thought this movie
could have been really interesting and
subversive you set up like a disposable
female in the beginning of an activity
and a character and then gets tossed
aside yes and now she is our protagonist
I was like oh what a fun twist she'll be
the action star for the rest of the
movie but as it turns out no she's just
the dumb woman who does whatever the
dudes tell her off she's a human
MacGuffin yeah I was gonna say the eggs
it was the exact same way she has no
control over what's happening she is
kidnapped and unkicked napped force
there's no concern over what's happening
she has no concern for her own safety
yeah
they see you were almost killed he
didn't want her to open the window but
they're eating in a public restaurant
none whatsoever it's like better trying
to kill her she was thing out of the
country bar wanna go dancing
she's just leaving him again like I
wasn't gonna plot about her wanting to
get away from them and not wanting the
protection sure that could be fun
yeah that would give her actually a
carrot yeah but you deserve to get
killed see well the best example of that
is they have her hiding out in a hotel room
oh by the way she's being monitored by two cops
one of them is played by the fucking guy from hack O'Lantern
the devil son
he's back
but they have her in a hotel room and she takes a shower just so we get some more gratuitous TNA
mm
and then she comes out in a towel
and even though they know they're supposed to be laying low
she's like I'm gonna open up the window and
they're like don't open up the window
why would you want to open the window
when you're in your tunnel I don't know
then immediately in the next scene she's
like why are you guys so grumpy let's
have some fun yeah well then they're
like I know we're supposed to be laying
low but let's go to a Old Country Buffet
what are they doing there he's he
walking he's on a treadmill the broad
back here alive he's in he's in rage
modes great he's angry when his line
deliveries angry you know he's very good
admit him walking a trumpet Cameron
Mitchell oh my god well okay let's let's
not talk about Cameron Mitchell let's
just show in its entirety all of Cameron
Mitchell scenes okay we're back it's 30
seconds later what do we watch recently
we watched kill squad yeah this this is
very similar to kill squad where Cameron
Mitchell is filmed at his house being
leisurely being the big bad guy he's the
main bad guy we cut back to him every
once in a while forever he'll freeze
Frankie this was Frankie and so I guess
I was expecting something very similar
cut back to him at his house he's with
girls he's having a party and then at
the end there's the big confrontation
between Frankie where you know he sits
down most of the time because it's
Cameron Mitchell yeah but he gets his
via of course because he's the big bad
guy they keep mentioning him as being
the big bad guy he's in two scenes that
are both less than a minute long it's
it's a it's upsetting to say the least
tragedy it's
tragedy it's a tragedy like it's worse
than like lazy camera Richa like won't
get out of the wicker chair Cameron
Mitchell cuz at least then you get a
decent amount of Cameron well and then
the fact that he won't get out of the
chair cuz he's too drunk is hilarious in
itself yes here it's like he's so angry
you need to you need to harness that in
your film
oh he's gonna know this is Cameron blue
balls yeah you get a little you get a
little tease and then he's out the door
he's off shooting for 15 more films
maybe that's what it was they only had
him for like an hour and he's like I got
I got five other movies to shoot this
afternoon he's not off to film 15 other
films other people are into his house
get out next crews coming in
give me my booze money 20 bucks leave
the girl
beautiful ha these poor people just had
their house
houses that are very easy to drive through
that is the saddest thing I've ever seen in a book for the worst movie
because this is just like some poor family
it's clearly like
they're just like oh it's a nice day outside let's have a beer
yeah 
you can tell it's like you know a family with not a lot of money
and then our fucking heroes jut drive their car through their house
and it explodes
and it explodes
they're like, you ran through our bedroom
the grim reaper was using their bathroom
the grip reaper showed up and was like, can i use your bedroom for about 20 minutes
and then a car drives through
even a character look I want to talk
about the truck that explodes it's like
the impact was so fast and strong
they'd been time and space missing the
light reflecting differently cuz the
explosion was so mad so the explosion
exploded
that even happened
who cares it's great but again some fun
action here that hanging out of the back
of a car they either jump from one car
to the other the flip dues and zip it
easy so then are there to find the
Diamonds and as it turns out the big
cops were the bad guys oh my god the end
what a shocker
it's like they hit that that wide you
know aerial shot with the the car and
the wacky banter and we're like wait
this is like a credit shot is the belief
is the movie over a movie can't be over
we haven't wrapped up Cameron Mitchell
yet oh it's over I know there's more a
story but this looks like the ending
shot of a movie so let's just stop and
that's how our discussion ends it's just
over
here we are to our final movie of the
night a Liam Private Eye rich why don't
you tell us that's a nice deflection
Jack I could try
I could try you can explain alien
Private Eye Lamoreaux this is a all you
have to do say his name and I'm laughing
LEM ro is a super hip and cool private
eye of the 80s it's like the 80s threw
up all over him dressed to the nines and
then he has to find the two halves of
the black disc and his detective work is
you know it involves asking people who
tell me what it looks when where where
why what kind of struggle where when
like what other people tell them what
happened and then he did his detective
work yeah he's very good he's the only a
private eye
yo and then this other log he likes
shooting people up with a drug so
they're like they could they can hang
around his warehouse while he worships
Hitler well he doesn't shoot him up so
they'll hang around at his warehouse
they hanging around his warehouse
so he'll shoot them up well it's a
vicious circle because he's the one
shooting them up still hanging around
his work yeah but the but this drug
there's there's you have to do a little
bit of math there's very specific rules
about how you take this drug this drug
was designed my plan about 30th century
technology it's what you guys on earth
are headed for renegade scientists
designed this to be the most addictive
drug possible you you you suit up one to
five times and you can quit and and
recover do this drug five times your
life but it's really hard because you're
hooked that's the first one yeah do it a
couple hundred times you die you go cold
turkey you die after five times well
after five pretty screwed is a 100% you
do it a couple hundred times ten
centuries after five times we haven't
shut up five times yet you die between
five and ninety nine times you gotten
your addictive you're addicted if it
gave me a double dose do it a couple
hundred times it's a 100 percent and you
need a complete blood transfusion to get
off of the drug fortunately that never
comes up but if you have the drug a
hundred times then you die you do it a
couple hundred times done one hundred
percent total blood transfusion you die
and if you've had it more than five
times five times you can quit cold
turkey you die you die five times a
couple hundred to die one hundred
percent you die after five times you die
doing this drug almost as good as having
sex you die so you can only quit cold
turkey if you've only taken it five
times six one two five one two five
times one two five I think yeah the
sixth time you're on that fucking road
where your shits just like might as well
enjoy it no you still have another half
coming to you yeah so technically you
could spread that five times into like
ten tiny doses you know I have a good
time
first of all doing this drug that's
almost as good as having
why would you want to do it the drug
seems extraordinarily painful 
yeah, it just makes everybody go, ow, my fucking brain
I need that soma
I need that soma
so yeah oh yeah because our our main bad
guy that gives all gets all these bums
hooked on the drug is almost so much his
name is Kilgore we talk about how
literate this movie is because that's
the name of the drug from a brave new
world the book by law to use hugs me oh
my god oh my god that's a deep literary
cut Wow
I did not know this movie was a lot
smarter than I was
it's the product that makes everybody
happy in the future and and cut to REM
low walking down the street looking like
Carmen Sandiego so not only is REM low
the coolest guy here on earth gets with
all the ladies right away he's also kind
of a celebrity back on his home world of
stir stirs something like that on his
beautiful and majestic home planets
terms
silver grass mountains 10 miles high
five moons 10 cents at night the air is
rich and sweet you want to drink it
more than breathe don't you have
pollution like we did we would pollution
500 years ago with the silver dress and the ten suns
you can't walk outside or you'll fucking die
so he's a celebrity on stir and and
the coolest cuz everyone goes to him for
their detecting needs when the other
aliens come to earth
well at the beginning of the movie we don't know he's an alien yet
you always think he's a cool guy in a cool hat
the coolest Private Eye ever
yeah
fucking slick as tits
saves a woman in distress
is he a detective or a pimp
we only use foley when absolutely necessary
he's standing there with a gun and of
course he's like let's go bones
let's go to my apartment where the wind
is talk louder close your windows
there's a star chemistry get down to the
basement
like Tom Jones is he gonna hit Mike
antenna under the hat with
but that reveal that he's an alien
you know she's into it
they they like he just met this woman and they're fucking
then she takes off the hat, and it's like immediately, just her body language changes, and she's just like--
but he keeps going
he doesn't know what's going on
he doesn't understand human contact
and it's amazing acting
her acting is amazing because she's just like yeah, yeah, oh no
 does very very quickly for his species
that was very long we're just 10 sons
that feels like
no wonder they say this drug is almost
as good as sex if their sex is that lame
like
my mom only said look at the years look
at the years now she woke up a lot
earlier than him too and could have
snuck out but she decided to get dressed
and wait I gotta let him know I don't
want to see him again
again I can't just leave him no don't be
I can't I can't leave this unclear earth
this fun City having a good time I'm on
vacation to aliens it's not earth it's
party city vacation that's what he got a
job as a private eye he started his own
business
that's what you do when you go on
vacation right yep yes start my own
business did you have to do all the
paperwork that's entailed yeah like he
had to rent an office space and like
he's rolling in the criminal acts
another alien bit he comes last round
well this this is important she comes
into his office his private eye office
and this is probably the longest scene
in the movie it looks like a student
film watch out for the microphone it's
gonna hit the fan Mike this year picking
up the fan sounds it's directly above a
fan
turn down the music we get a special
cameo by the boom mic watch ladies I
mean whoever was the boom operator
decided that the best place to put it
was directly above the ceiling fan so so
lady Falcon comes not a not a Vulcan
lady not a Vulcan comes she says I'm
looking for the disk or I have half the
disk something with the disk and he's
like I know I need you to find the disk
he just saw half of it what does it look
like it's the worst yes but then next
dude comes in who is just crushing his
accent yeah he's doing the world's worst
people is that like Victor's friend just
gave him a roll throw him a bone
victor is the guy who made this movie as
what else this is what magical
combination where you have written
created and directed it's all the same
man the credits is fixed or starring
written and directed and if it's all the
same name you have gold nut starring
wears a sari
no victor is not alien private eye oh
that's directed edited it was almost the
Holy Trinity yeah but his name is just
it's just credited as Victor yeah which
is a pretentious at all
Victor big Thor went on to create early
edition a show that nobody remembers
but that's the weirdest thing the he
only has two credits he wrote directed
and edited alien Private Eye and then he
created a network television show that
lasted several season it's called a
really edition which by the way I've
never heard of it until you guys thought
it was in the nineteen it seems like a
really fun premise but like by created
by he like just told someone like yeah
what if there's this show and a guy got
a newspaper a day early assault crimes
yeah I think at that point whoever he
was telling it to left but he tried to
continue and he's like and that guy was
an alien but they were like we're not
listening to you anymore weirdoes
his name is LEM ro is it really addition
did start as a televised diversion of a
private eye so yeah the the alien we
found out that that lady alien and Peter
Lorre are our alien cops they're space
cops space trademark they knew not to
try to call them space cops space police
yeah they meet up with LEM robe because
he's the best to find this black disc
which they say could be like an atomic
bomb
it could be the most dangerous weapon
ever we don't even know what kind of
destructive powers this thing could have
that's why we need to find it yeah and
so he's on the case well it's also isn't
the disc like the half that the bad guy
has that's what's used to make the drugs
or something about that well I think you
need both sides has later
it makes the drug yeah it's not like a
super weapon it just makes a drug yeah
and apparently our bad guy is capable to
make it with just the one half he has
yes that's in the front teen when it
takes the bow that's what the drug
should do to you but instead it goes
almost as good as sex it would have made
more sense if when LEM ro was having sex
if he started going so lady who was
being raped by Kilgore gets kidnapped by
Kilgore so he can rape her later yeah so
she's now set up to be kind of like an
addict slave of Kilgore which will come
into play later in the movie for some
reason but on the flip side of things
LEM ro goes to infiltrate the bad guys
in between having sex with the alien
woman well he finds out where their lair
is yes and so then he has to go back to
his apartment so the lady found where
their lair was so he can go right back
to the lair to steal the desk well he
had to change he was in full white he
couldn't go into a dark place now after
Labor Day the nican pumps is that is he
going to his Michael Jackson outfit at
that point I guess they're all kind of
Michael Jackson yeah yeah Jackson outfit
so he except for that pathetic one where
he's just wearing like a tank top with a little fur
that was my favorite
what is it
what is it
he's playing dumb
or he forgot
we had an elongated scene
we had a 15-minute
we had two separate people explained to him what it is
it's okay everybody
lemro's on the case
they ran out of ideas for stupid shit
so then they just that was like uh whatever
look, that was as laid back as lemro gets when he's like, when he's like at home on his own
those are like his pajamas
still has his gloves on
his fingerless gloves
he's like, just getting ready for bed
i gotta put my tiny cape on, get ready for bed
good night lemro
you know he says that every night
good night, lemro
hey, lemro
you did a great job today
snuggle
uh, so he breaks into the bad guys lair
yes
uh, we get my absolute favorite shot in the entire movie
that's the exact appropriate reaction
there's a picture of Hitler on the wall
oh yeah that's it that's let's eat
let you know that he's in the bad guys
like want you to dance out of the chicks
yeah yeah well especially in the room
that he goes into or that that Hitler
photo is it's like it looks like the set
of the Merv Griffin Show or something
that's like a talk show and then just
Hitler just a little awkwardly it's not
just says framing on the wall it's like
up high it's in a weird position who he
apparently worships as a deity we
discovered pray to Him he'll help me
find this disc even though he worships
Hitler he admits that he's in hell I
love it wonderful sound effects doing
there you are the Foley artist you just
wanted my neighbor Jake Foley people who
walk this might think that you're you're
doing that like you're making the bad
Foley noises no this is in the movie
like the Gipper kids you know the guys
in UHF and they're like yeah
that's the kipper kids okay so hit then
at the end of the movie they go back to
the the bad guys headquarters and sneak
around oh oh no no no we forget about
the the blonde girls whopper ooh
Oh can you explain this to me
and does it make any sense under any
possible contact I can explain to you
the logistics I cannot detail why it
happened so what what happens
so the bad guys capture the girl said
give me the disk the girl goes whoopsie
there you go then it just so happens a
truck passes by and what was a very
they're very they they know traffic
patterns they're very meticulous very
long trailers to a very long trailer so
as the truck passes they put the
girlfriend in the car and take out of
the car rape drug girl from earlier they
replace her with the other girl and
shoot the rape girl so that the good
guys think that they shot the girlfriend
yes mmm
for what purpose they want to make him
think she's dead so he doesn't follow
them to get the disc yeah if you can't
have sex then it's not worth living why
not just kill the girl like what do they
care so but at what it is do badly
everything about this is uncomfortable
and embarrassing the movie or our
discussion it's uncomfortable to watch
and it's embarrassing that they wrote it
that could be the tagline of every
episode so but that actually lights a
fire under LEM ro and he decides to bust
out the ultimate alien weapon which we
had never heard of before and didn't
know existed
flash leg gauntlets
the lembreaux and the space cops burst
under the bad guys firing flashlight
beams and real guns shoot twice and then
he gets to the main confrontation with
Kilgore and he just throws him to the
ground because I was like winning this
fight you know fair man-to-man I've been
waiting for it yes and so Kilgore takes
off or he throws down his guns and and
oh my god we forgot about the priest
what happens oh that's true yeah well
the priest isn't important what happens
in the scene with the priest is
important this is like I don't know
halfway through the movie it just cuts
to a priest yelling at the door this is
the first time we've seen them launched
or visited Kilgore this priest have a
relationship before the scene my costume pornos
yeah he breaks it yeah okay I'll be
right there
very important - we should get out of
here first right there so the tooth
makes a comeback is the important point
yes
swallowed it I guess I swallowed it
I don't spit it out it spits in it's a
bad place to have dangerous acid inside
of your own mouth the canister punches
him in the stomach and that makes the
acid go down his throat yeah I think he
punched him in the mouth right before he
was gonna do the spit so instead of
spitting and just literally I just
punched him in the stomach
who cares he did something that maybe I
should go down his throat
my favorite part of that scene is, uh, lemro is completely unaware that there's an acid tooth, so he just thinks he hit him really hard
oh
i guess i did a pretty good there
and then the movie's over
yes
yeah
that's it
we're done
the movie's like we're done
just fuck it, lemro's just done
that was great
yeah
victor
victor
victor
you have to pronounce it right
all hail victor
so now we are at the part of the night
well we have to figure out which of
these movies is the oh this genre Babel
I was gonna say if it's best of the
worst that seems like we have three
rules where the best movie is the movie
that is the most entertaining for any
reason and instead because this episode
is battle of the dominoes we had to
select the movie which is the best
representative for the genre it is from
J movies is the battle of the genre
before we battle the genres let's just
take a moment and I'll agree that alien
Private Eye is the best of the worst
here's the thing it's the best of the
worst but some terrible sights like yeah
terrible 
if we have to pick best of the best representation of its genre, I gotta go with action USA, because there's so many car stunts and explosions and people hanging out of helicopters and people falling through glass
people fall out of buildings and it's not a fake dummy
it's a real person
okay
tim
spookie's is like a clusterfuck
yeah
okay
tim
yeah I would have to agree with Jay
I mean action is in its title for fuck's sake
uh, spoopie's, i mean, it's, uh, Spooky's is, it's somewhat scary, but it's just like
it's somewhat scary
is that what you just said
so easy I mean it's a horror film it's
like they're John it's lady lighting
them exactly but it's like god it's just
terrible and there's no sci-fi in that
it's live flashlight yeah I want to the
Spooky's is almost there where the
creatures were really meet yeah I the
electric ticket but if I might interject
yeah I'm kind of with you on Spooky's
Spooky's has a shitload of effort put into it yes
but action USA is is so fucking lazy
it's so fucking lazy
they can't even get
the explosion right the trip up before
the car hits it but there is an
explosion explosion there's nothing lazy
about the stunts and the action in that
movie there is an explosion there are 17
creative different monsters well someone
created a 50/50 it's there's 17 creative
monsters and a werewolf man I love I
like the creatures I want us all I'm
gonna give it to Spooky's okay so it's a
tie and then the best movie of the night
alien private I lost and we have to
destroy it no I think what happened is
since those two are a tie they cancel
each other out and the winner is alien
prize
