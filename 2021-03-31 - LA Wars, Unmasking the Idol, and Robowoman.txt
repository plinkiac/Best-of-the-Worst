tim
the matter you look worried
well it's i just see a lot of labels
mike
i see a lot of pretty pictures and
colors and yeah these beautiful vhs
tapes with all their colorful spines
titles graphics
this doesn't feel right why what are you
worried about
black spines
you think we invited you back here for
another black spine episode that's all
you do
and now it is time
to talk about our first movie la wars
for real tell us all about l.a wars
la wars went up when power crazed drug
lord raul
guzman moves in on a mafia la cocaine
trade and steals
the mob boss carlo giovanni's
money and drugs the street explodes
in violence featuring
vince murdocko oh
uh-huh yeah featuring ring of fire two
and kickboxer
two somebody out there knows who that is
yeah he's an undercover cop jake
quinn he infiltrates the mafia
as the bodyguard for giovanni's
beautiful daughter
carla jake must use his martial arts and
all the weaponry he could carry to
defend carla from
guzman's hitman hitman hitman
that's good uh okay well is that it no
it's not it okay why maybe this is why i
should be on black spine
go okay giovanni's ruthless right hand
man
vinnie betrays him and tries to rape
carla
but is stopped by quinn vinnie is
humiliated from the fans to seek revenge
well they just told us the whole goddamn
movie and i
after seeing seven thousand movies like
this i feel like i've already watched it
so we could just move on to the next
film sure i'm fully prepared to talk
about this in detail
after not having seen it
here
they're hoping for a lot more extras for
that
and i made sure it had one of the
largest budgets in the city now it's
payback time
she's giving her all her
mike what's next wow
this is unmasking the idol which is
actually a sequel to a film that we
watched before called order of the black
eagle
and as ridiculous as it sounds it is a
super secret
agent and a tuxedo who has a baboon
sidekick
named boone who drives a tank around
and and interestingly enough this is the
same
ape that starred in shock ma
secret agent duncan jacks that's the
main character that's him
jax duncan jacks must form an elite
strike force
to stop the sale of atomic weapons to
the scarlet leader
mankind's most evil and sadistic
adversary
can one be an adversary of mankind
it sounds adversary sounds like more of
a personal word
yeah is the villain another baboon i
hope so
uh yeah so this is released by 20th
century fox and
mgm they released a movie with with an a
secret agent at some point
oh god they're going full james bond
yeah yeah this is more than the other
one i think
i don't remember it having a theme song
like this
this isn't devil's island yet oh this is
the south american this is the south
american prison where they're going to
get the third person to help them
oh god this is like rise of skywalker
we gotta go to the place to get the
thing to get to the other place to get
the other thing
what are you doing duncan
oh my god oh my god
let's fill them you've spilled them all
over the floor you [ __ ]
it's filled with jelly beans that's
filled with
friendship bracelets why would you break
it open now
so the audience can see
i gotta pick all these up now well
that was unmasking the idol i don't
think they made a third film featuring
duncan jacks and his
baboon sidekick well how old was boone
in this one
i don't know he may have passed away
after the second film he retired he
probably just
binged he's like this is gonna be great
he partied with john belushi a little
bit too much horribly wrong
one night he was irreplaceable
this is ankle biters vampires like
you've never
seen them a small
town is overrun by ankle-biting
blood-sucking dwarf
vampires shouldn't be a small town is
under-run
no it's overrun they think it's the
very first pun they could have done all
right um
things get complicated when the
vertically challenged coughing creepers
get their itty-bitty hands on the sword
with the blood of the last slain tall
vertically challenged coffin creepers
vertically challenged
coughing creepers with their itty-bitty
hands
so they get their itty-bitty hands on
the sword with the blood of the last
slain
tall vampire with this relic they can
create a
super race of shack sized
draculas out of any tall
human
i don't want to watch this anymore
there are no short fixes to this
tall problem oh my god
two and a half hours no no
oh if anything has a short running time
it should be this
oh my god is that
vhs yellow oh
spongebob
don't you dare take the name of texas in
vain
you go squirrel i'm squidward
mr krabs gary the snail
tell us all about our next film robo
woman robo
woman she dates
then she terminates
after a savage physical attack by a
group of men
a woman undergoes illegal experimental
cybernetic surgery and is fashioned with
robotic
parts and vision however the surgery
causes havoc to her brain and before
long she's on a deadly rampage of
revenge
bonus features trailer oh okay
70 minutes 70 minutes no kidding wow
my favorite movie 10 is the best news
i've heard
all day yo should we go watch it
night yeah
like developmentally challenged yeah
oh my mom used to work with people with
special needs
i grew up with people with special needs
your mom's still watching
routines are always a big deal i'm
getting sex tent vibes
oh yeah but that was a famous actress
though i know
yeah this is this is like this is richie
somewhere between the age of
32 and 67.
does she not know she has robots she
didn't notice
oh look at how wrinkly it's like the
rubber rubber halloween costume so
here's the question
did they find that robot glove in a
costume shop
and the movie came from that yes oh yeah
oh yeah
we can make a whole movie around this
amazing robot glove
okay you're out of your surgery
everything went well
rule number one don't ever look at your
arm until you get home
oh yeah yeah she didn't notice her arm
so what'd you say after that i told my
perfect coordinator
she can kiss my ass
thing of the time
you just have this look of disgust
like just like pure disgust
this is definitely a bar or not a pizza
place yeah
giant red pepper flake right shaker on
the table
and they're all drinking plastic cups
filled with water yeah
dining hall at the bowling alley right
i just want to see little kids run by
like head into the ball pit
you know that's kind of what it looks
like
well we're here again for another best
of the worst
that's been a while this is just
traditional three movies
picked mostly at random uh
and our first film is la wars aka
la wars uh tim what is the plot of la
wars so first off there is the giovanni
crime
family and the crime family is doing
crime in
l.a but then all kind of crime
just crime it's drug crimes
you're supposed to move with the bag of
flour from the shot was it in the shot
yeah oh my god it was i thought he
like they're cutting flower into it to
cut down on how much the cell or
something but
or maybe it just isn't supposed to be
there i think it's not supposed to be
there
and you're doing it right on top of a
toilet lid for some reason
i gotta tell you that's where most of
the people snort their cocaine
right on top of a toilet so that logic
applies to where they
they manufacture and cut it as well yeah
you're gonna snort this cocaine well i'm
gonna just tell you that it was made in
a toilet
so you better snort it off a toilet so
most meals are
cooked in a bathroom
but giovanni is running the climb family
and then there's raul guzman
who is a mishmash of like
at least five hollywood actors i
i think he is the genetic offspring of
ted danson
and jose canseco let's start at the top
let's do a family tree here sure because
we're we're at the top we have
jose danson who is the head of one crime
family
the other crime family head is uh
not martin sheen uh martin sheen tony
bennett
uh his daughter is carla not
carla is not his granddaughter it's his
daughter this is just his daughter it
looks like it should be his
granddaughter aka
aunt becky and we call her aunt becky uh
aka
hobo lookin he complains about the
streets
her stylish hollywood clothing as as her
looking like a bum
very nice you're not dressed for dinner
you're not mic'd for dinner you look
like a street bum
and then later when she dresses up she
wears a wedding dress
but the other crime guy one of his
henchmen or
hunch woman is my big fat greek wedding
lady
who wears skimpy shorts in the one scene
and
that's now that's raul guzman's yes yes
the other chronicles
uh jose danson yeah not martin sheen
yeah
this right hand man is al pacino
yes martin sheen's right-hand man is not
al pacino al pacino's
stand-in young al pacino like
godfather one godfather two not not
like but jose danson's right-hand man
is not iced tea the other martial artist
in the film
yeah yes so oh [ __ ] so
um so these are the wars these are these
are there are two
rival gangs this is said la war
more
you're late
oh my god
wow that is not how you hold that gun
that's why she completely missed and
accidentally hit that car instead
that was her car
it's it's important to point out the l
the the titular la
wars are on like a three block radius
of hollywood boulevard uh hollywood is
not the same as la when you think of
hollywood
like hollywood for people that don't
know if you've never been there because
people think hollywood the glitz and
glamour of showbiz
hollywood is a [ __ ] dump hollywood is
is dirty and it's filled with like
souvenir shops
yeah and and people in like wolverine
cosplay but then there's north hollywood
and west hollywood which are
technically i think different cities but
they're nicer areas but no but this
movie is shot in the dirtiest parts of
hollywood
so i think the the best way to exemplify
this
your sentiment jay is the daughter of
the mafioso
goes shopping and instead of going to
rodeo drive
in beverly hills where you would have
your shopping montage by a rich
daughter of a mafioso she goes
accompanied by the song i love l.a of
course for sure that's how you do it
she goes to nasty nasty dollar stores
souvenir shops with like going out of
business signs
the barbed uh or the the metal grates
that they close so that no one smashes
the windows
and takes all their stuff during a riot
yeah it's funny too because we see in
the movie you see the the like the
hollywood the walk of fame the stars on
the walk of fame and
i guess people associate that with also
with the glitz and glamour of la but
it's like people have to pay to get
those on there
yeah it's not anything fancy and it's in
the worst part of of
hollywood it's where bums sleep it's
where bums urinate
and sleep in the same spot some of those
stars that people kiss
poop has been on
it's true it's true yeah wow it's a nice
little photo op for your your hollywood
vacation
i'm kissing kerry grant if a hollywood
celebrity has passed away people go and
put flowers on it and they just
instantly shrivel up and die
from all the toxic waste and fecal
matter on the ground oh there's some mud
on cary
me wipe that off but then all of a
sudden
like uh things happen in front of some
low-life
bar like security guard
look tough hey [ __ ]
tell laugh boy over there to put the
money back and put the gun down now
whoa yes he beats up the guys with the
shotgun
yes it's not established that he works
at that bar
just just these these angry guys come in
with guns and and
uh vince what's his name vince murdocko
is the actor's name what's his
character's name
something jack jake wyatt jake quinn jay
quinn
or just shorten it to one word and he's
jacquin
what is that flowers with jaquie
quinn
all these stunts are like when you do
the run through where you do it slower
in rehearsal but that's the actual tank
that carpet man
oh my god jay there's 68 dollars in the
register
shotguns be nice i could bust you on two
cops oh he's a cop
yeah what do you think he was just a
vigilante
yeah uh it's [ __ ] long story well
what's the name of the bar you mentioned
that he he
he's the bouncer to bar you looked it up
it's real
bronigan's brannigan's brennan's it's
it's a famous uh bar in los angeles it's
not famous
it's famous because it was in this movie
it's probably not famous to us it's
probably famous to l.a locals because it
says it's been around since 1942.
that doesn't mean anything and their
website literally says save our bar
but britain oh borders foreigners it's
called borders
yeah this is the website it says it says
they can't see that save our restaurant
he yeah he he midnight as a security
guard
borders and he's he's an la cop during
the day or he's been laid off for three
years snatched of his
his back because he just shoots before
he asks
questions we don't know any of this in
the introductory scene with him though
no
it's not like yeah he's chit-chatting
with the bartender and he's like so jake
when are you gonna
get back on the force i don't know man
it's been three years since uh
i think he shot some guy who was like
attacking or assaulting a 12 year old
and he said it's quinn's law
quinn's law quinn's law rorke a 12 year
old will not be abused by sleaze boss
it's my only law it's very specific
i've waited my entire career
for this oh sure he should be the the
college
quarterback yeah oh look at that who's
that
did you see that person in the corner of
the frame i saw the blue mic too
what you need to know about jaquin
phoenix
is that he is like the ultimate cliche
movie is the ultimate [ __ ] cliche
this is cliche
cop movie cliche the movie now you used
to be a good cop
that was there now i work at a bar as a
bouncer because i begged a child
molester
hell man you killed it with your bare
hands he was regular 12 year old girl i
caught the bastard in the act
you went outside the system quinn you
didn't even have a [ __ ] warrant her
scream was all the warrant i needed not
according to law
but aside for all the shootings
the fact there are multiple scenes where
the the l.a wars we
actually see them in the film we see the
la wars which is
the two rival gangs shooting and killing
each other
at heart this is a love story
if anybody are out there watching this
our um strip club aficionados
you will rank this strip club in your
bottom your bottom percentile
maybe a one star maybe a half star i
mean they were big
but she didn't see that expression
though like through that whole scene
where it's like
is the camera rolling uh remember she
doesn't even know if she's supposed to
be performing yet she has that face
gentlemen i'm looking for a guy named
crazy wayne
you know what do you want it for man
that's the guy he beat up in the first
scene isn't it yes
didn't he shoot him
he's a different character oh my god
he's a bandana he's clearly wearing a
bandana
he's a different person here we go
oh freak everybody just stand still
because right now i want to kill
somebody
oh and i don't know we're unrelated
right now i want to kill somebody
here's four hundred dollars
remember us the next time you want a
place in bed thank you
that's a 1991 oh right yeah you're right
here
the worst person in it is our league
yeah yeah by far
and their pants their pants i mean if
you pulled up their shirts
their pants are way above and they
remember how they walk too
yup they're all just like at one point
vince merdocco was wearing a girdle
and let's talk about guzman and in the
shirts a
cosby sweater-esque yeah type thing
yeah um mark for more
patterns it looks like it's suspended
the tv show full house was a shirt
that's a shirt i saw five different
actors in raul guzman oh
okay okay who did you see okay i i will
say though real quickly
that that actor was uh he was in a bunch
of andy siddars films
he was in hard ticket to hawaii
but anyway jose canseco yeah
ted danson also i get matt dillon
eric roberts yeah and
uh there's gotta be a little
schwarzenegger in there
just like he's got like the hair with
the hair dude he's gone
the hair and i guess the build a little
bit yeah
if he does just say only 116.
once it sees but that's just it it's
like i named like five other people and
just
like me and just a kiss i mean that's on
par with some of his children right
that's a joke about shorts and then
there's a legitimate children
is it one of those gentlemen
one is the dog walker
one is the dogs one is the dogs
one is my great-aunt beatrice
i don't know wait a minute one of your
children is your great aunt
waitress hey who knows that's [ __ ] i
guess crazy time loop
arnold impregnated his great aunt what
would his child be to him
his second cousin
what is this baseball
i am your father's brother's nephew's
cousin's former roommate
she was just hiding in the oh my god how
long was she in
thank there oh wasn't that a week ago
he does infiltrate the boss's daughter
she's okay with it
she she infiltrates him she comes out of
the shadows like a
[ __ ] vein she sneaks into his room oh
yeah she's she's the sexual predator
yeah um but but they have a budding
romance they they
go i guess they go to the beach she
feeds their french fries but they end up
they go i think they oh she's like i got
tickets to the ballet
and i don't want to waste them let's go
and they end up in a parking garage
how did they know they were going to
park there
and that's when the scooby-doo van shows
up filled with
ted 18 jose
danson's bad guys
oh my god time for some kickboxing he
had to put his gun down
to take his jacket off to be more
comfortable
that is something that you probably
shouldn't do
so you can do this yeah
so they're driving a white corvette and
they
park in a parking spot in between two
bmws
15 seconds later one of the bmws is
replaced with a hooptie
for jack quade to get repeatedly punched
on during an
action sequence altercation and then
instead of getting back into his car to
get away
they hop in the hoopty and uh and steal
that car
you can't blow up that white corvette
you better hide uh we'll hotwire this
piece of [ __ ]
i mean i guess the justification is
maybe the van is blocking his actual car
sure jay whatever
oh and then the scene ends we were like
ooh car chase car chases
beautiful car beatable car you know what
that means oh oh they're in the shakies
pizza
then the movie just kind of falls apart
the beginning of the movie
is just hanging on all of the cliches
it's branching from one cliche to the
other
like a jungle gym and then it's just
kind of hanging on by a thread
technically
because the movie is like just barely
holding together because we see like the
boom in one shot
it's not a technical mistake
you're gonna hang me in my backyard news
that's the most disrespectful
al pacino has betrayed he was he was
spying or he was he was not loyal to
he was mad he couldn't get the girl and
that crime boss threw him out after he
tried to rape his daughter
that was that was a big affront to him
and then he betrays guzman
and takes over what's his face's empire
and kidnaps his daughter
it kind of comes together again at the
end though when he decides to rambo up
after scene no that was the fake final
show there are multiple final shows
that's true he gets
suited up and then he goes to the
mansion and you think it's gonna be the
final showdown
yeah that's right and then and then it's
like you know uh super mario brothers
oh no our princess is in another castle
yeah that's right oh carla's not here
[ __ ] you quinn i'm out of here
and you can't do [ __ ]
well there was my favorite sound
what song that door opening with the
squeak out
we've used it a million times he's at
all the time but it's always sunny in
philadelphia too
so the the still isn't the final climax
scene
he ends up back at the old bean factory
which was guzman's
lair but it's now which is just a big
factory full of car beds
this is business a race car bed
little tykes race car bud oh that's cute
that's a
that's a tough warehouse
nobody expects the crime lord to be
dealing with kids [ __ ]
this is a playskool factory i'm gonna
take you to the toy master
each race car bed is filled with
bootlegged chinese legos
but now it's fake al pacino's new
headquarters and i guess
he was waiting for jake
to chase him down but he's just sitting
in his office and his henchmen are
standing behind him and the girl's just
sitting there tied up
i think he won the crime wars and that's
just where he lives though
he just killed the two crime bosses is
like
well he owns the city i'm i'm yeah i'm
i'm the guy that killed the two bosses
so
everybody's gonna [ __ ] listen to me
and keeping his new bride like
sitting there uh with her hands and feet
bound
forever will pose its challenges i think
maybe he just said we're gonna sit right
here until you say yes
okay maybe yeah yeah that would be a
scene we didn't see yeah
i could stay in this bean factory all
week i don't know about you
i got nowhere else to be i know you have
a wedding dress
poor man's pacino was standing and like
iced tea was with him but did anybody
else notice that he was just wearing a
trench coat with no shirt on
he's just like i was doing i was doing
my flashing
and then you call me up and just like
you say that
oh no he doesn't but it's like that it's
like he's sitting there
and he's just got a trench coat on yeah
you know and you don't see anything but
like just bare chest
under and i'm like you just [ __ ] just
get you off the flashing stream he
subconsciously knows that a
kickboxing fight is going to break out
and so he's prepared for it
and missed up missed up spray them pecks
he wants to sh
you want to glisten he's in a shootout
right and he's like okay i feel kung
fu's coming up
i'm going to put down my gun and take
off my blazer
during the shootout then i'm going to
pick my gun back up yeah yeah
it happens like three times shame on the
adversaries who were just like
oh what the oh you're taking your coat
off okay hold on hold on
it's honor code yeah it's the code of
the streets
it's of the wars the code of honorable
coat of honors
coat of lords coat of honors see that's
a
pun
keep this up we're going to run out of
cardboard boxes
you knew
wow that was so clever that is not see
that that's not a heroic thing
to do no furry's been an [ __ ]
he is an [ __ ] he's an unlikable
protagonist
well before before that fight right he
has to kill the fly girl
uh in in the most shockingly violent
moment in the film
oh my god wow
jesus
oh my god
in a movie full of people getting shot
to death but it's all just like generic
squibs or whatever
and occasionally he'll like break
someone's neck it's it's nothing
but then this one fly girl gets
violently murdered and blood just shoots
out of her head
like she's being attacked by a phantasm
ball yeah
i spray out the mouth and then like when
you see the lifeless body on the floor
you'd think that the girl would have
been the one that uh fly girl would have
been the one that carla had to fight
the obligatory girl fights sure why not
and because it was established carla
knew her way around
firearm
in the parking structure scene but she
did not know her father was the most
famous crime lawyer in the country
yeah that's the most shocking revelation
in the film why is everyone after me
what you don't really know why no am i
supposed to
has to do with your father and what he
does for a living what do you mean
wait what it does for a living what she
doesn't know what her father does
i haven't been around to know much what
i do know is that my father's a very
successful businessman
over halfway through the movie all of a
sudden we realize that she has no idea
that her father is the biggest crime
boss in the country
i think she's just in denial she my
father's just a businessman she's just a
businessman i think that's
i think that's what it was okay when he
said it was a cutthroat business
i thought he was just being metaphorical
i thought that noose was decorative
he called dad the christmas news
so that's a happy ending everybody dies
but
jack wade and jacquin
not aunt becky uh and becky
amber amber thief yeah and they they
sail off into the sunset uh
in a car nobody watching cares nobody
cares nobody cares
nobody cares about anything what are we
doing here why are we doing this
we're wasting the time and money with
this stupid war
well the war is over
so the next film that we watch is the
prequel to
a movie we did three four years ago
five twelve years ago eighteen order of
the black eagle uh
this is the the first film in the duncan
jacks
saga unmasking the idol
uh rich oh wow what is the plot of
i am asking the idol i am absolutely
relieved of jesus
jesus [ __ ] christ oh thank you james
i will never forgive you thank you so
much jay i appreciate
will never forgive this for this from
the bottom of my heart
oh thank you so much i don't know why
you're so upset robo woman's gonna take
you two seconds to explain
yeah but i gotta talk about the elephant
in the room
rich has to talk about the baby talk
about the baboon in the room
this is not a prequel this is just the
one they made
first sure okay uh duncan
jacks this is one where they didn't have
it figured out yet yeah
they they didn't know their winning
formula no this feels like a prototype
to order the black eagle uh
unmasking the ideal
ideal unmasking the idol yeah features
our hero duncan jacks
who is a ninja that wears
chainmail armor only on his face yeah
duncan jacks is not related to basement
jacks
who made a music video where their band
members
all turned into monkeys nor duncan heinz
people turned into moist ass cakes
so he is a british ninja
who works for an unaffiliated secret
agency employs ninjas
to steal gold what if
each ninja style is
bred to thieve a different
ore
so duncan jacks he's he's their top guy
he specializes in gold
yeah there's like a palladium and uh
yeah the second
in command the silver yeah yeah
you're a sophomore you're out there
you're collecting aluminum
it's like i feel disrespected do you
want to be a talc ninja
whoa whoa you're going to
devil's island five to get a stockpile
of
zinc you get your head out straighter
we're gonna put you in the mercury
division with those crazy bastards
it's the 144th most important mission
this week
oh you got enough time
to cut a human-sized door sure
take your time because he's familiar
with traps like this like indiana jones
oh how did you know there was a hole
that would a full a foolproof release
lever
it's on your right your other right
oh boring
he's put on this highly dangerous
mission where he has to recruit
three different people to uh
storm the world's most heavily guarded
island
which they didn't really need any
specialist because they just show up
with like
30 different ninjas yeah
and all of the planning was completely
for naught yeah
basically what is this
it is kind of like a james bond movie
but it's also kind of like a saturday
morning
kids cartoon show because there's a
secret agent with a
with a baboon and and it's it's very
cartoonish
but it's not like like serious
is the usual spit bet sir yes double oh
and seven
very good sir oh my god oh that doesn't
work
that doesn't work maybe the writer was
dumb enough to think that was really
subtle
they wouldn't yeah only the true fans
will get this line
uh he goes to a casino at the beginning
and he his roulette numbers are double o
and
seven uh so there's things like that
where they're like ah
do you get it it's like well yeah of
course we get it there's a range there's
somewhere between
you know like james bond probably
classic james bond actually probably
even somewhere in the middle
then you got like ultra serious jason
bourne and then you have
completely silly austin powers and
you're not in the middle you're it's
you're not sure what you the problem is
you're not sure if the comedy is
intentional or unintentional
it's like do they mean for this to be a
joke
yeah or was that double oh and seven gag
really meant to be
subtle like a wink wink well maybe some
people will get it like a wink wink and
they thought that would be really sly
and instead it was just stupid yeah yeah
the lead actor
uh he he's only been in two films we
looked him up he was only in the two
duncan jacks movies and it's weird it's
not like he's he's got less credits
than the baboon that's true that's
absolutely cool
who i have to point out had a big role
in the fly
for [ __ ] sake yeah yeah yeah but this
guy
he kind he's not handsome he's not
you know he's not like suave and like
i'm a handsome spy he kind of looks like
michael bolton
yeah um and he's not a terrible actor
but he's not a great actor
he's not like a good comedic performer
no
he has a weird like i think intensity
this is what throws you off a lot as far
as what the tone of the movie's supposed
to be right
right
must be that ninja you've been talking
about it's a baboon
i'd like you to meet the most
intelligent primate in the world
his name is boom boom this is china
it's like what was he going for drying
debonair
yeah but flippant yeah he's like
playing a spy but he's not playing it
for yucks he's
just kind of like well at a certain
point you pointed out that he almost
never blinks
and that's all i could think about i
think if
you ever want to watch this movie i want
to just lay a bet down that
it's maybe 30 times throughout the
entire
film that you actually see him go yeah
it's probably less than that yeah
and i asked you during the screening i'm
like who's the same fat like is it aimed
at
adults i'm looking at the shelter and i
see now it's rated pg
like a children's field there's so many
people getting shot yeah
and they murder remember they they
literally dump
two elderly people who are alive
staircase sequence
just random old people just old people
because it's fun to torture them
so this movie is yeah too tame for
adults
but uh too dry for kids and not fun
enough
and our kids will want to see more
monkey yes
adults we wanted to see more monkey
that's why this is like the prototype of
the sequel because the sequel
we get more monkeys yeah we get we get
boone driving a tank
we get a cryogenically frozen hitler
which is fun
this is a wet dream for any escape
artist who ever
thought balloon
balloon is the way it happens more than
once in this film how are we gonna set
our spy movie apart from all the other
spy movies
baloo hot air balloon he sneaks into
a 1970s hotel somewhere
in the world to steal a micro cassette
from a safe hidden behind a portrait
and then the bad guys are on to them and
then they shoot at them
that's awesome i don't want to jump into
water that wasn't a dummy you just
tensed up you know country what you
would think
the secret agents tell you to not go
limp when you fall
right go stiff ghosts
go stiff you really want to break the
surface tension to that water
go stiff but duncan jacks and his bag of
spy tricks
has a special chemical bomb that blows
up
that doesn't make his enemies pass out
so he could climb out of the pool and
just walk away
it makes him temporarily stunned so he
could slowly get away
yeah this already slowly flowed up into
the sky
oh my god what
oh duncan jacks get into my eyes
water's getting in my [ __ ] eyes full
of chlorine
what is this a hot air balloon yeah
you know what it's kind of neat jay a
very slow getaway in a hot air balloon
is what you do i mean i guess he did
the ball that they shot must have had
some sort of yeah
tear gas that's what allowed him to get
away that's fine
he planned it
how did he [ __ ] fine did he know he
would jump into a pool
yeah that was part of his plan he's
trying to break into a safe he's a super
secret agent okay he's got nobody
he was able to get to the roof a
building
so he knows there there's a pool on the
premises
i'm still here that took forever i'm
home fortunately the balloon
happened to float over here yeah
you know what i'm gonna give her credit
as silly as it was
as silly as it was it was novel i have
never
seen an action scene like that before
that's true
there's probably a reason you haven't
though it's this weird-ass
giant balloon coming out of this pool it
needed boom to fly by in like a plane
though to pick them up
well that's again the second movie new
to have boone involved in the opening
action sequence
for a second i'm like did i forget that
boom flew the
[ __ ] but wasn't was that the same
point where he was late okay
was he throwing [ __ ] this is christmas
boom ho ho ho
time to pass out the presents be
generous
he's not very good at controlling how he
throws because he's a baboon
that's fine [ __ ] where it goes [ __ ] all
y'all he's the most intelligent primate
on earth
i know but he
you should see the least intelligent
primate spy
because it was a disaster his first
mission
they went through so many monkeys before
they got booned why do you have a baby
we put him in the tank and he just ran
over duncan
teamed up with our most intelligent
baboon yeah
they complement each other perfectly
they do a perfectly adequate job
they're perfectly in sync perfectly in
sync
that's when they broke uh are just
backflipping in front of the people
they broke orson wells out of south
american winery
that's right that's right and boone was
throwing
bombs at guards basically the only good
parts of this movie are when boone is
doing something
and he's not doing it and he's not doing
and it's pretty much this yeah
but but they learned they learned like
like in in this film we get a scene
with a really you know kind of kind of
neat vaguely need scene with an atv
and a guy jumps up and grabs the atv you
know we're gonna bring that atv back in
the sequel
that's why there were no more duncan
jacks movies
they flew too close to the sun the
insurance rates went up
was ian hunter like racked with guilt
and he made a declaration declaration
right there on the spot
i am never doing this again i am
done i killed a stunt man i'm leaving
acting and becoming a michael bolton
impersonator
i will play casinos across this great
nation
and i won't blink once
he went on to be an internationally
renowned staring chick customer
contest champion
a 280 pound man on a three-wheeler rode
over my
face i caught my foot as i was going
over and i remember turning a flip but i
thought
oh wow i landed where i'm supposed to
this ought to look really good
but we had rehearsed it with a gun
mounted on the three wheeler
so when they put that on it changed his
turn ratio so he came wider
and he rode right over my face when the
guy rode over my face when he felt the
bump
he had gunned it and actually spun the
tire
on my face oh i was a mess i was
i was drugged up i just didn't care so
duncan jax is in the casino
yes the stereotypical james bond
sequence where he gets in a tuxedo and
gambles
in a casino and he befriends a lady
they have they have relations he heavily
befriends her
right it's like it's like the bond girl
basically like that scene where james
bond is in the casino and then
he brings the lady back to his room and
then which i thought they were parodying
later on when he's in the hot tub
and the camera like dollies out and
there's like 12 ladies
but then there's a couple guys and he
throws it all off if it just kept
dolling back and it was like lady after
lady after lady
like that would be funny
how do you know this uh primate
we work together oh so you are a ninja
but she disappears after that i think
she's
some says something suspicious
all i know is that when we cut to the
first scene with our main uh
uh villain the reds what are they called
scarlet
whatever they say you catch my drift old
man
sure what have you got to say not that i
really care
but i was like it's like a mask and a
voice box and it's like that's going to
be a lady
like i knew immediately yeah yeah but
why is
why would she disguise herself in front
of her own people because it's for our
sake oh so the movie could surprise the
audience with this character we saw
before
in five minutes in the opening of the
movie and then
duncan jacks attacks her they fight
beats her mercilessly beats her up
pretty good and she's like she's like
okay
i'm gonna go get in this world war ii
fighter plane
while everybody's escaping in giant hot
air balloons and i'm gonna
fly around duncan jackson's
duncan jacks is with his not love
interest
no not linda hamilton yeah with the
monkey
in a jeep that's being attached to a hot
air balloon
yeah wow a lady flies around in a world
war
ii not attacking them not attacking them
and then he goes like this
and then she goes like this live to
fight another day
i think i think i think she was going to
be a prominent recurring character in
the
long running duncan jackson
she was scheduled to come back in the
fifth one that was before the atv
accident
was this kevin feige's first like
attempt at like like
setting out a franchise unmasking the
idol
part five 1996.
and he's got he's got the timeline and
it's like kevin kevin it's over
it all would have gone up great if we
didn't run over that stuntman's head
the stunt guy's suing the studio you're
finished kevin you'll never work again
my career is over yeah all right
robert downey jr wants to do this iron
man thing he's a husband he's a washer
he is
no one will give a [ __ ] if he runs over
someone's head
whatever we'll try it it'll never work
but i'm trying
ted prostitute loving coke addict wants
to make an
an iron man fill a shirt iron man nobody
cares about
superheroes ah whatever
what about duncan jack's three kevin
it's over it's
over coming can we put any atvs in iron
man
no no what about a monkey a baboon
they should have put a baboon in iron
man that would have been great that
would have been
if jarvis was like a little monkey
if this works maybe we'll give you a
raccoon
i'd rather have a talking tree
get the [ __ ] out of here all the marvel
cinematic universe is
unused ideas from the sequels
from the seven undeveloped duncan jacks
films
what if duncan jacks teams up with zeus
shows up and we run over his head with
an atv
kevin you're young you're plucky you've
got a lot of years ago
forget the dunking jacket stuff move on
it's over it's over the dream's over
move on to
your little iron man project
the monkey wants out too
he's got a starring rule movie
maybe it was the atv incident that made
boone walk away from
the movie industry as well yeah i mean
john landis talked about it
movie sets are too dangerous you're
telling me
well robo woman
uh you talked about a movie already
right i did think you talked about
it yeah talk about the wars you talked
about l.a wars
i definitely talked about i'm masking
the idol oh rich oh rich you talking
about non-masking in the items
oh mike well what we have a third film
and i think you have to
you have to explain robo woman
i'm so sorry it's okay i deserve it
it's it's karma right for all my years
of
mental and physical and emotional abuse
and elderly shaming talking about this
movie
may constitute elderly shaming i'm not
sure
and it helped me to figure out just what
i need to do
in order to get past all of this wait
let's
i refuse
i am contractually obligated to talk
about one movie per episode
and i have i have done it already
rubble woman released by wild eye
releasing whenever you see the wild eye
releasing logo on the back you
know it's quality click off you know
it's it's at least
15 steps below gravitas ventures
uh their
this case this release of this film
should be criminal
the last thing that i need is someone
looking at me like i'm some sort of a
science experiment
of course of course i'll let him know
i'm sure he's very respectful
but i'll tell him what to expect thank
you
i think
i can't believe we're watching this
this is one of those movies you don't
watch like you just
throw in the trash right yeah
yeah and we're watching it
i mean you know you know how they have
laws against deception and advertising
sure sure i mean this should be
criminal yeah how bad this is um this
may be the worst film i've ever seen i
know i've said that
and it's you say that a lot and i'm not
gonna disagree with you in this case
it's not hyperbolic it's beyond cringe
i have to come to terms with it every
time
i lay down at night and i can't even
close
my eyes that's your evil [ __ ] and his
friends tried to use me as a
[ __ ] toy i can't do this
you have to reg i can't do this this is
what you signed up for
you're stuck here forever can we make
this black spine
this is something beyond cringe and i
was legitimately
uncomfortable watching this and why is
that
because you ah you're gonna explain it
baby
he's gonna get your spam because
he didn't even see anybody um
yeah yes okayF
yeah and uh okay so this movie takes
place in egypt
on denial
it feels like i'm watching 911 footage
yeah it's absolutely horrific yeah
the bad news it's got a strange
fascination to it all the same
the filmmaker is named dustin ferguson
dustin ferguson
and he makes a movie every 15 minutes
yeah
he has yeah if you go to amazon prime
there's a plethora
of films that he's directed films that
he's
directed yeah and and so we didn't know
that at the time we put it on we watch
it
and and then you see our lead actress
and jay you said she started off her
career as
more or less an extra she is an
uncredited extra
in like blade runner so all these things
like going way back
yeah not no major acting roles
just kind of like uncredited extra this
character this background character
one episode of l.a law or something like
that
background one line bar patron and then
there was a span of time from 1996 to
2007 or something where she
didn't work and then so now it feels
like
this movie feels like oh i want to be
a famous actor i want to be the lead and
it feels like a vanity project continue
he's doing it for me
mike you're doing a great job of passing
the buck
he's doing a great job making you tell
this chase the sucker
he's doing it for me this character
lives with a roommate
and it's supposed to be like a younger
character
we think we think it's hard to say by
the movie but
as you said the actress was born in the
50s a late a lady who works at a
company gets assaulted and she becomes
has to
a robo-woman and has to kill her
attackers the script could call for
a woman of any age but this is really a
role
for a 25 year old yes someone who's
young
a temp has a roommate blah blah blah the
script it's like like
um linda hamilton's character in the
terminator sure
linda hamilton has a roommate uh
and the you know are you sarah connor
god listen to music while i get back
exactly and linda hamilton works in a
diner
where little kids put ice cream and her
smock yeah right and so that is a role
for a woman who is
well she [ __ ] 19 years yeah yeah
early 20s right so much less than
60. yes yes so the role is for a 20 to
25 year old woman
clearly the woman who's playing the part
is not that which makes you wonder is
this entire movie her idea
in the same way that like a gedivin
where you have a
a middle-aged uh what was he a lawyer
or a real estate guy but real estate is
neil brainman
is yeah there's a level of out of
touchness because i don't want to say
like a 60 year old woman can't star in a
movie because going back
going back to lindell hamilton she was
in the newest terminator movie and
whatever else you want to say about that
movie
i don't think anybody complains that
linda hamilton stars in it
can i stop you right ahead linda
hamilton was playing
sarah connor as a six-year-old woman
linda hamilton
in 2020 could not play
linda hamilton in 1984. sure the lady
who plays robo-woman did she approach
the filmmaker
dustin ferguson and say dustin i want to
i want to act again i want to
start make me a star right i have 80
thousand dollars i will give you my
1990s
camera i'm ready for my far up
mr ferguson
like i said i did move a few things
around so i hope that's okay
here
oh look at her look at the robot oh he's
gonna rub out our under jersey glasses
of course tactical vision
i almost had a legit spit
that was that was a close call
so so you have a script right called
robo woman and the general plot
we're just going to lay it out here the
general plot is
her character is a as a temp at some
kind of company
and there's a creepy guy who says why
don't you come out
with me or blah blah blah birthday party
yeah
and it's a trap i hope it doesn't go
against the uh
non-compete clothes because this company
is known to be a little too happy
nothing for you or what you're worried
about oh my god
what what my brother who has special
needs
i don't know why this is important to
the plot because the the filmmakers saw
i spit on your grave which is a rape
revenge movie where one of the four
rapists
has a mental disability right
uh as his birthday present to his
mentally challenged brother
so that the scene happens the rape
doesn't occur
it goes thankfully yes thankfully for us
it goes wrong
they just said [ __ ] it you know let's
kill her they stab her in her shoulder
and they leave her in the park to die
and so this is actually a a a
futuristic science fiction movie that
takes place in the year 2024
yes the far distant future future where
cybernetics
are an alternative to traditional
medicine
for those who are poor enough to where
they can't afford traditional medicine
so it's like
oh i i've gotten blinded by
mace or pepper spray i can't have my
eyes fixed
by traditional doctors i have to get a
jordy la forge visor
and
filled with blue tarps painting tarps
good old blue painters no tarps
not that's not what you should do
now we only overseen by mel novak
does her accept them fix my i have to
know again to amputate my arm i gotta
stand at the shoulders so they had to
amputate my arm
now her eyes got taken from her
unfortunately
and she gets the red vision with the
nice
big block in the middle
you know that doesn't even mean anything
there's no numbers there's nothing
it's just exactly how does that make it
better oh it's from natural
sight yeah look if you were completely
blind you might you might put up with
the giant reticle
right in front of your face i see a big
square
and i'm [ __ ] psyched i can actually
see that
[ __ ] square i'm okay with it
because mel novak pulled my eyeballs out
he's got butt hair on his head
well they took her arm hair that's why
he amputated the arms
did you say butt hair mel novak's butt
hair yeah because
it was just like the plant that i
thought you said buck hair
because like they transplanted deer hair
to his head
it is the future there's a lot of deer
out there
in the future deer are all here
during the great nature wars of 2022
ain't no bone and deer they pull off the
skin from deers and they graft it onto
heads of bald men
yeah yeah and you got deer you got a
nice deer head of deer hair
wisconsin-born deer hair
you're welcome mel nose melanovac thank
you melanoma you're a pioneer in the
hair transplant
world if you're if you're really wealthy
you could afford like a patch of deer
that's got like a
big antler
it's a status symbol in 2022 2024.
their alums breed without the use of
these crude machines
how can you do this i mean how can i've
been working on this
well over 30 years what is the focus of
that shot
you know they had like 12 inches
they could only afford one tarp they
didn't have a tarp
behind her so they just filmed the back
of her head
yes because he couldn't just film these
angles
and then move her and make it appear
that it's the reverse angle
and the filmmaker dustin ferguson has
the camera
from 2002 from 2002 it's it's like a
mini dv or a high 8 camera and he
doesn't know how to switch the
focus from auto focus to manual i mean
it's
it's atrociously on a technical level
this is
shockingly bad for a movie made in 2019
yeah oh yeah
i mean dslr cameras at this point are
are cheap enough [ __ ] [ __ ] iphone
camera an iphone looks better than this
yeah i don't know what's what is the
problem
if i don't know what like
cameras they just didn't have the
lighting well they definitely didn't
have
they let this movie with car headlights
i like hide and seek where are you
the lighting i can excuse you you go out
to some desert location right
you don't have power i mean like i get
that you have to light your scene with
headlights i
totally get that but but being unable to
film
in hd on a somewhat decent camera with
somewhat decent resolution
in 2019 or understanding the basic
framing of a shot and he works in groups
but if you'd rather work one-on-one
like your attention should not be drawn
to the uh the potential fire hazard
outlet behind her there's some guy's
window
so many scenes in this movie take place
in her and her roommates robo woman
and her mates apartment and just like
the framing of it is completely wrong
well there's there's the shot there's
the part where a robo woman does her
training with the like the jiu jitsu
mats
oh yeah and he's he does dustin ferguson
places the camera down right and robo
woman and the guy are in the in the
background in the foreground is like the
pads from some kind of like
weightlifting machine and
the camera just auto focuses to that and
they're blurry in the background and
we're like
and they didn't make them either what do
you wish to do with the new found
control
i will make things right very well
it's just like it's like we're gonna
listen to these pads first
there might be some discussion behind
the pads
don't don't pay attention to that
there's also the scene where she's
sparring with him
and it's filmed entirely from the back
of her head yeah yeah
maybe dustin ferguson has a back of the
head fetish
because that's a reoccurring thing
throughout the film so yeah robo woman
is on
is hellbent on a quest to destroy those
who
attempted to rape her but failed to rape
her
yes and stabbed her yeah rob a woman
says i'm just going to decide to leave
my apartment
and i'm going to walk down right to the
dumpster
yo [ __ ] you looking for some action in
the neck
why would she just walk down to the
dumpster
oh well that was easy
what did he do he didn't say anything
she's crazy she's crazy now
oh that's right her brains because her
robo-brain is great
i knew that was gonna happen see only
the servos in her arm work
don't they start groping at her no
that's the other guy who grabs your
boobs
okay yes that's a different scene that's
the uh the gun dealer
that'll be two g's two of these
buddy listen lady
you want protection and i'm not the kind
of guy that needs some protection
you just handed her a [ __ ] gun you
idiot
this is the dumbest rapist i've ever
seen
he says here's your gun now i will grope
you
my that's very grab my two g's here's
your loaded
gun i know i will now assault you
unarmed
while you hold this armed
gun yeah yeah but she kills the two guys
by the dumpster we don't see it we hear
sound effects
don't say it because they couldn't shoot
it i'm glad that they took
you know what to try i don't know if
anybody else
is in tai chi like i am oh i'm totally
into it yes you know
but do you run just into like a space
and stand there
i like that they didn't go out to like
the like the desert in california which
is
relatively close joshua tree is so
[ __ ]
yeah it's a little a little yelled hat
but they've gone on to like best kids
rocks investigators
they go out to like where like
construction equipment is as
paved the dirt for like a new housing
development
like town houses being built in the
distance behind the beautiful sunset
oh it's nature
and between in between condo development
and the golf course
and the new costco it's the desert it's
beautiful it's such a beautiful
wednesday morning
i feel like so it's
just very special wednesday morning
beautiful wednesday morning
i don't think i've ever eaten like this
i'll just go get the picture
all right so that's our three movies uh
this is the point of the night when we
pick best of the worst
uh uh best of the worst is l.a wars
we're done
oh no we have people thinking about it
now
all right okay tim no you know what it's
like
wars is good it's good
it's and it's the best of the worst
it is don't try to sweat his phone no no
no no no no
he needs to have you actually this is
the first time i'm actually
thinking of what's best the worst
everything else was as you should tim
thank you it is your opinion that's true
thank you
don't listen to you jason
you look at these three films and you
say what is to me
to you what is best of the worst what
did you enjoy the most
entertaining for any reason yeah what
did you enjoy watching the most what did
you have the most
fun watching
actually it would have to be l.a wars c
ally wars yeah
uh rich
i don't even know how this is something
you have to think about
i'm i'm gonna say robo woman just
because i want to see what kind of chaos
mike is going to cause
oh my god oh my god just for that reason
okay nice are you gonna derail
everything no no i'm not i
i will never ever ever say robo woman is
the best of anything okay then my pick
is l.a wars
okay fair enough but to be fair to be
fair it's close between
l.a wars and unmasking the idea really
yeah look out
i was mostly bored by unmasking the idol
a few cute things and i'm asking the
idol
a few cute things if i were to say the
classic
best of the worst movie would be
l.a wars because it does hit a lot of
the b-movie hallmarks
and it is quality and while there is a
vhs on display
there is a for some reason this vhs
looks like
like like blu-ray quality when we
watched it i don't know how that works
but beautiful blu-ray transfer
done by our friends at vinegar syndrome
yeah this vhs copy yeah i don't know how
they did it
and and yeah unmasking the idol is
fascinating
it's a nice trial run for the far
superior order of the blacky
we could put unmasking the idol in the
fascinating category but
uh if i were the best of the worst is uh
l.a wars because it it's it's that
quintessential b-movie
kind of movie out of the three it's l.a
wars
the robo-woman is is is despicable trash
what the hell are you doing let me ask
you guys this do we want to destroy
robo woman yes yes
yes robo woman this formula can enhance
you robo woman
