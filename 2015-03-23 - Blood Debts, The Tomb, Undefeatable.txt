Rich: So, Josh--
Josh: What?
R: [Perks up] What are we watching today?
JH: Oh! [Puts down the guitar and grabs tapes from the shelf] Well, we’re watching three action movies today
R: [Flatly] How exciting
[Silence]
JH: Yes! [Nods]
R: What action movies are watching?
JH: Well, the first one we’re gonna watch is called Blood Debts!
*Movie #1 Blood Debts*
JH: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, he is the jury, the judge, and the executioner,” end of quotes, exclamation point
R:.......Okay!
JH: Bad grammar. Alright, umm, so what we have on the front here, we’ve got, um...mustachioed fella with like a track jacket and, uh, a giant….
R: He has four arms
JH: He does! Got three muzzles, four arms...and one glorious mustache
R: I--I wanna see a movie about an action man with four arms now, three on one side
JH: I know
R: What would you call that?
JH: Ganesh?
R: Tri-Punch!!!
JH: Tri-Punch…[Laughs]
R: Triple Fist!!!
JH: No, Triple First is a whole different kind of--”vengeance in the tradition of Death Wish,” we’re gonna have a bad time. “Following the brutal gang rape and murder of his daughter, ex Vietnam vet Richard Harrison sets out to execute the perpetrators of this heinous crime. Outraged, he becomes a one-man vigilante squad set on putting an end to other criminals who cross his path.” Other criminals. So he’s a criminal
R: Technically, vigilantes...are criminal
JH: That’s a fair point. Uh, “when his wife disappears, he is contacted by her kidnappers and told that there are numerous unpunished criminals on the loose, and after he kills them, his wife will be released.”So the kidnappers want him to do what he’s doing
R: Okay! That’s convenient
JH: It really is. Uh, “Harrison then goes into a killing frenzy--until he realizes that the people who kidnapped his wife head up the biggest crime syndicate of all. He must then put an end to them and save his wife--single-handedly”
R: That sounds wonderfully generic
JH: It really does, I think….I think we’re---I--I really think we’re just gonna feel bad...after watching this movie given….the plot and the picture, and it’s unrated. [Points to the picture on the back] This lady’s getting attacked by all these people, this is--this is rape…
R: Ohhh they put it on the back of the box
JH: There’s that giant gun, which I’m looking forward to that. And then, uh, this fella’s just...getting all fucked...by this gun [Talking about the picture of a man with a gun in his mouth]
R: That’s fine (?)
JH: Alright. [Puts the case on the shelf] Alright, so that’s that
R: [With fake enthusiasm] Let’s go watch Blood Debts! [Hops/jogs away] (?) Come on!!! [Josh waves] OWW!! [Crashing noise] 
[Camera pans around, Rich falls to the ground and groans] 
R: Ow, my back, I can’t get up! Okay….okay….[Manages to get up] Come on!
JH: Okay, let’s--let’s go watch Blood Debts [Sounds like “vest”]

[3:21] M: That was some pretty good acting

[3:28] [Men shoot at and surround a couple out on a picnic]
JH: This is--this is what happens to me every time I try to have a picnic

[4:04] Jack: So, no offense, man, but you’re old as fuck, why are you going after someone who’s like, half your age? [Guy takes out a gun but it gets slapped away] Oh--there we go
M: Should’ve started with the gun
R: He wanted it to be personal (?) I--I don’t know
M: Don’t make excuses for him

[5:03] R: Alright, Josh…
JH: That was the movie
R: Our next movie is…[Holds up the tape] Indiana Jones and the Tomb!! [Camera lingers on a doll of Rich jerking off a droid toy]
JH: I don’t remember that one…
R: [Looks at the tape] Wait, it just says “The Tomb”?
JH: Oh
*Movie #2 The Tomb*
R: Uh, starring….Cameron Mitchell
JH: [Exhales] Now, I wanna get excited. I wanna get excited about that, but we’ve been steered wrong before, however, he is top billed
R: He is top billed
JH: Top billed
R: Right next to John Carradine. [Waves his hand] And Michelle Bauer, whatever. Sybill Danning, David Pearson, who gives a fuck about any of these people? Alright, The Tomb. “From within the isolated shadows of an Egyptian tomb, a legendary demon comes to avenge those who stole her sacred treasure”
JH: Kay
R: Grave robbers journey to Egypt and violate an ancient tomb!!”
JH: Hmm-mhm
R: “Which unleashes the fury of an immortal Egyptian princess!” Lots of, lots of demons and whatnot
JH: That’s great
R: That is great. “Using her evil mystic powers, she follows them to Los Angeles, seeking her revenge.” So, there’s probably going to be--
JH: Wow
R: --a kickass opening sequence in Egypt, then most of the movie’s gonna take place in L.A. with the people wandering around wondering who’s a demon
JH: Hmm-mm
R: (?)
JH: Probably
R: “She destroys the thieves and ultimately threatens eternal life itself.” [Josh laughs] That’s not much of a threat
JH: She threatens eternal life?
R: Yeah. “I will make you live forever!!!”
JH: Oh no…
R: Nooo, don’t do that! Uh, “man’s courage is pitted against her evil powers in a Battle of Will against mysticism. This action adventure stars Cameron Mitchell, John Carradine, and Sybill Danning. Color, 84 minutes”
JH: Oh! Okay, good
R: A--a--a news update
JH: Yes?
R: This is directed by the man who did Alienator
JH: That means nothing to me
R: [Looks at the camera] It should. [Looks back at Josh] It should, Josh
JH: Okay
R: I’m gonna go watch the movie [Walks away]
JH: Don’t fall over again
R: [After a few seconds] Oh, plot twist, I didn’t!

[8:35] JH: Alright, so our final movie for today is…[Grabs the tape from the shelf] Undefeatable 
R: Alright
*Movie #3 Undefeatable*
JH: Is Undefeatable
R: Spoilers!
JH: So it’ll be the best movie
R: Okay
JH: ‘Cause you can’t beat it. Uhh, “out of the ring, into the fire, in a fight to the finish”
R: You may as well just call your movie “The Good Guy Wins”
JH: [Laughs] “A brutal killer ignites the fight of a lifetime. Karate champion and martial arts superstar Cynthia Rothrock--” remember Cynthia Rothrock?
R: Was she in The Flintstones?
[They stare at each other in silence for nearly 10 seconds]
JH: “Cynthia Rothrock rips into action against a serial killer, facing her most dangerous opponent ever!” Ever. “Struggling to put young sister Karen through college--” college is her worst opponent [Rich chuckles, then Josh] Her worst opponent ever. “Struggling to put young sister Karen through college, martial arts expert Kristi Jones (Rothrock) earns fast cash by competing in illegal back alley matches. But Kristi’s rough and tumble life takes a terrifying turn when Karen falls prey to a savage killer!”
R: Oh my gawwwd?!
JH: “As the police working the case discover a trail of murder victims, their only clue is the killer’s grisly trademark, an unusual martial arts technique known as the Chinese Dragon Claw!” Uhh, “teaming up with a streetwise police detective (John Miller) Kristi sets out to avenge her sister’s death and must fight for her life against the most lethal adversary imaginable”
R: College?
JH: College. “1993, color, 95 minutes”
R: Okay!
JH: Rated R
R: Oh, good!
JH: For (?) situations
R: Oh. Oh!
JH: Like college
R: Boobs
JH: College
R: Boobs--
JH: College boobs
R: That’s acceptable. That’s preferable, actually. I wouldn’t wanna see old folks home boobs
JH: Not in the movie (?)
R: That’d be rated X [Josh furrows his eyebrows, Rich laughs]
JH: Alright, alright, let’s--let’s watch the best movie...it cannot be beaten, is Undefeatable
R: Alright! [Josh throws the tape in the air, Rich slaps another tape upward]
[Camera gets up in Rich’s face] (?)
R: What--what--AHHH--

[10:57] M: It’s a commercial for how durable mom jeans are [Jack and Josh laugh]
JK: Ah, the tall butts of the early 90s

[11:54] KJ: Yes, listen carefully. My name’s Kristi Jones, and I need you to get a message to Sergeant Nick DeMarco immediately
R: Or anybody
JK: Or just any--any police officer...
JH: If Nick’s there, that’s cool, if not, just…
M: Send a bunch of cops to the (?) building
JK: They’ll never guess what’s happening there [Rich and Jay laugh]
JH: You’d--you’d think the cops would just hang around the (?) building
M: Yeah, yeah [Rich chuckles] They order ten thousand pounds of packaging peanuts every day

[13:45] JH: When--when your gun and rape club is just wandering around the forest, looking for people to gun up or rape, some fried chicken is gonna be a casualty

[14:26] JK: Is that the Batman transition?

[16:25] JK: His shirt tied up? (?) That’s not American. Look at both of their--they have their shirts tied up
M: Yeah
JK: What the fuck is that?

[16:36] JK: At one point Blood Debt’s wife is kidnapped
(...)
JK: But then we have a long stretch of the movie...20, 30 minutes, where the wife is not mentioned at all
Woman: It’s no problem, they gave me a bit of a lead
*Blood Debt’s wife is currently being held hostage*
BD: Christ. You just ruined my day
Woman: Sorry
JH: Remember how your wife’s kidnapped?!

[18:51] R: Any time there’s a woman in this movie, who’s...who doesn’t have an escort, it’s like the rapists all just start creeping out of the woodwork

[19:05] [There a musical montage of women being assaulted, “It’s more fun in the Philippines” appears at the end]

[19:52] JH: Uh, what’s Mark’s wife’s name?
M: Uh, Mark’s wife
JH: Correct
M: Yes. It’s a completely coincidental name [Rich and Jack laugh] [The credits roll, and Mark’s wife is credited as “Mark’s wife”]
JH: He was very lucky to marry somebody whose name was Mark’s wife
M: “What’s your name?” “I’m Mark’s wife”

[2:08] M: You know...the--the--the action scenes weren’t particularly good
JH: No
JK: No
M: The most you could say is that people got shot

[22:40] JH: Consistently pushing Blood Debt too far never worked well for anybody
M: No
JH: And they do not learn that lesson...throughout the entire film
JK: But it’s ok, ‘cause they have a special device to deal with Blood Debt…..they have the Super Nintendo Super Scope
JH: As seen on the front cover…
JK: As seen on the front cover
R: Are you sure that wasn’t the purple space bazooka? 
[Silence]
JK: There’s a badass bazooka that has an uncanny ability: it makes everyone jump!
[A weak explosion goes off, everybody inexplicably jumps then falls to the ground]

[24:57] M: Someday I wanna be able to say “recruit more pimps.” [Rich and Jack laugh] I’ve never said that in a serious conversation

[28:54] M: Well….[Sighs] This was the worst movie that we’ve ever seen. I’ll speak for all of us

[30:26] R: You know what we never see in the movie?.....That hat 
M: No
JH: No
R: That hat never shows up--that hat is a complete fabrication

[32:24] M: [Shows Rich the case] Look, that’s Cameron Mitchell [After a second, Rich knocks the case away]

[33:40] R: In--in this movie, he’s actually on the phone, and you could see him reading his dialogue. Looking down and reading his dialogue
JH: I don’t have a problem with that

[34:24] M: Cameron Mitchell should’ve been the--the sexy vampire [Rich laughs]
JH: Sold. I’d watch that. I’d watch that
M: The second they open the sarcophagus and he’s in there. And he’s drunk…
JH: “I’m gonna suck all your blood!”
R: It’s a requirement, to liquor him up before filming his scenes. Yeah. Yeah
Jessi: [In the background] Do you think that, like, in that scenario, if they opened it up then he’d tell them to “close the damn door!”?

[34:59] Cameron Mitchell: Dr. Mayonnaise?
R: Mayonnaise?

[35:06] JK: To me, the most important scene of the movie is Grandma Stripper

[36:06] JK: Shit, girl. I bet you got back problems

[36:13] [Rich knocks the tape down]
M: It was maybe the worst thing we’ve ever watched
JK(?): Yep
JH: I think it was, I think…
M: The funny part is, only 84 minutes long, and it felt like 5 hours long

[36:24] [A man walks in wearing giant sunglasses]
M: Oh my god, he just had--uh, cataract surgery

[39:10] [After Josh explains the plot of Undefeatable]
JK: Shockingly accurate, you--you missed one key feature: in the universe of Undefeatable, every man, woman, child, and therapist knows Kung Fu
(...)
R: Everybody knows Kung Fu
M: [Laughs] Even the psychiatrist? (?)

[39:49] R: He’s a violent psychopath who likes ripping people’s eyes out
JH: Why(?) he’s got so many eyes in so many fish tanks 
(...)
R: It’s just the one fish tank, Josh. He only has one fish tank
JH: That’s enough
JK: That’s one too many
M: What….
R: He hasn’t collected enough eyes yet to nessisate--nessitate two
JH: You think you can get there?
JK: Try that again
R: He hasn’t collected enough eyes yet to nessitate two
JH: You think you can get there? [Jay laughs loudly in the back] “Necessitate”
R: “Necessitate”
M: Do you want another beer, Rich?
J: Nessitate
R: Nessi--huh?
J: It’s “necessitate”
R: Necessitate
JH: Somebody...
M: You’re missing a whole syllable
R: He doe--he doesn’t have enough eyes yet to necessisate--ness et--ne--[Jay laughs] Fuck it!! Fuck it, I’m done! I hate you people
M: I know you do
R: Why am I here?
M: I know you hate us, especially me, but I want you--
R: I could be working at a tollbooth
M: Ah--that would be preferable
JH: Could you get that job?
R: Hohohohohoho!
JH: Oh, no, I didn’t mean that as an insult, I meant--
R: OHH!! Damn!!!
[Jack wags his finger, Josh shakes his head, Rich gets up to leave]
JH: Ohhhhh…..
R: Goodbye!
M: Well I guess Rich was Defeatable
JH: Ohh…[Rich opens the door and leaves]
JK: That’s true
[The Undefeatable title card is altered to say Rich Evans is Defeatable]

[41:24] M: And then, our other character is...Cynthia Rothrock?
JH: Hmm-mhm
M: And she is a street fighter, who is a waitress who earns money by.....it’s almost like touch football…
JH: Kinda
M: -equivalent of--of what--what, uh, Stingray does…
JH: If you fall--
M: Once you push some guy on the ground, you win!
[Plays clip of Cynthia Rothrock winning a match]
R: It’s the tamest street fight ever
JH: Nobody seems to bleed or really be injured that badly
M: So the bloody duels to the death take place in some kind of facility boxing ring with--with boxing gloves
R: Yeah
M: And then the--the--the tame street fights take place in a dirty alley
R: It’s--it’s like the touch football version of street fighting [Background music stops]
JH: That’s what he just said
[Silence]
JK: That’s what Mike just said
JH: He just said that
[Nobody speaks, Rich looks down and shakes his head]
[Jack laughs, Rich gets up from his seat]
JH: Aww, goddammit
JK: [Laughing] He said that two seconds ago
[Everybody laughs as silently as possible]
JK: So that (?) really good show...I mean….thanks everyone for watching Best of the Worst and uh--
J: The last episode
JK: We just can’t do it anymore, we’re done
[“Rich Evans is Defeatable” title card shows up again]

[44:22] JH: Uh, so the--the--the expert that they call in about uh, uh, like, grips...he knows only 3 people in the U.S. that know this particular grip, and it turns out that none of these 3 people are the person that is actually killing everybody
M: And--and they all live in a 1 mile radius--
JH: They’re all just--
M: Which is very convenient for the police investigation
JH: Yeah, yeah. They’re all just right there. And one guy has been out of town for a month, one guy is in a wheelchair, and then the third guy just gets beat up for his troubles
R: Why are they taking on--
JH: Because fuck the police
R: Why are they taking on faith that the one guy’s been out of town for a month? Maybe he--maybe he’s not out of town, maybe he’s been running around killing all these women. They just, they just kind of take that for granted
JH: That’s good police work right there...
R: Yeah
JH: Rich
R: Yeah…
JH: Is what that is
R: [Laughs] That’s...that’s real world police work
JK: Well, maybe, like, he would be a suspect but the--the--it went--it went dead, the trail went dead there, I think you can’t do anything more, so they’re--they’re checking out their leads
R: Hmmkay
JK: It’s fine
M: Quit making excuses for the cops

[46:21] JH: And then they all end up in the basement where the final battle happens, and they’re--and, uhh, police guy and Stingray are beating the shit out of each other, and then Cynthia Rothrock comes back in and starts beating the shit out of him, and then there is a hook just kind of situated on the wall--
JK: Wait, woah, woah, before we get there…
JH: What?
JK: We need to talk about shirtless dudes

[47:30] JK: And we get awesome flexing and top bodies...
M: I’ve learned there are a lot of buff dudes in L.A.
JK: Yeah--
[Silence]
JK: So they get all greased up, and, and basically just kind of...slap their meat together for a little bit, which is wonderful
JH: Was it you that said, while we were watching, there was a couple of t-bones just--[Slaps his fists together]
JK: That’s all it is, just meat clacking
R: Couple of--couple of meat slabs going at it, and, you know, it’s a shame that’s the climax of our film
JH: Oh, it’s not
R: Cynthia Rothrock…
M: Rich, did you just say “meat slabs” and “climax” in the same sentence? [Pause]
R: Yes, I did. Yes, I did, Mike

[48:56] JH: This poor guy is hoisted up by his fucking skull, and then just goes away…
R: Did you just call the rapist who’s been murdering innocent women a “poor guy”?
JH: I did!

[51:20] JH: And then there’s been this kind of running joke about, uh, her gang can’t get into college because their IQs are too high [Plays clip] Ah ha ha! And then Cynthia Rothrock turns around and says, “well, guess what, I actually did enroll you in college against your will, and you start Monday”
CR: Go ahead and laugh, I enrolled you guys. You all start Monday
R: Whaaaaaaat?!
JH: And then she kind of ha ha ha, and they say, wh--aren’t you gonna go to college? She--pshh, no, I’m not gonna go to college, and then her cop boyfriend’s like “I--I’ve--I’ve enrolled you in college, and you start on Monday!” [Plays clip] And that’s not how college works--
R: College for everyone!
JH: Everybody college
M: And in the theater Oprah Winfrey shows up and says, “and you’re going to college! And you’re going to college!”

[52:16] M: So, high pants, you gotta oil yourself up…
JH: Yeah
M: And, uhh…
JH: That’s how you defeat a rapist
M: Yeah. And hanging him on a hook, by his eye
R: Is that what happens on To Catch A Predator? I’ve never watched that show

[58:39] R: Yeah, I think it’s unanimous. Actually, I want to unwatch the movie, if at all possible [To Josh] You said you had ideas on this earlier?
JH: I think I’ve got a little plan, how we might just unwatch this movie
(...)
M: [Voice-over] After introducing our third tape, for no good reason at all, Rich Evans smacked the other two tapes, sending them crashing down to the floor. Unfortunately, this broke important internal mechanisms inside the Blood Debts tape, damaging what might be the last copy of the movie known to exist in the universe. Faced with a strong desire to watch a Filipino rape film, Josh performed the world’s first VHS reel transfer, in order to save the film [Josh takes the reels out of the tape] Using the case from an even more worthless tape, the Blood Debt reels were successfully transplanted. And except for some early tracking problems, the tape played perfectly.
Man: Well, how come he knew that...we...we were after his ass?
JH: We got the tape that will work 
M: Alright
JH: [Shakes the tape] Nothing rattles
M: Okay, let’s try it [Voice-over] In order to unwatch The Tomb, Josh again performs a reel transplant. This time, inverting the tape so that it plays backwards. Hopefully, when we watch the film in reverse in its entirety, we can forget ever having seen this nightmare of a shitfuck film
[Film plays backwards, everybody acts dazed, image gets blurry]  (?)
[Jay walks in]
J: Hey guys, what did you think of The Tomb?
[Everyone turns their heads slowly]
All: The what?
