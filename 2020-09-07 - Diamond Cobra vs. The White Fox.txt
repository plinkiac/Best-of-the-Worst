No.
No, I won't do it.
No matter how many times you ask, I'm not gonna kill them.
Hey, Rich!
Oh, god.
Oh.
Hi, Mike.
How are you doing?
Are we watching a movie today?
Why, yes, we are.
And I have it right here.
Star Trek: The Next Generation?
Oh, wow, that's great news.
I love Star Trek: The Next Generation.
It would be great news if we were watching Star Trek: The Next Generation.
But, inside this case, I have a Blu-ray.
Annabelle, stop.
I challenge you to tell me the name of this movie.
Literally, this will be the first time I have seen this.
I don't know what's going on.
Rich doesn't know, uh, Jay and I have seen this film before.
Rich has not.
Um, and, this is his first time ever viewing the case.
Tell us what the film is, Rich.
Diamond Sorra, the White Fox?
She's got a pirate thing.
Eyepatch?
Eyepatch.
Now, what is it?
Diamond Sorra.
Sobra?
Diamond, Diamond...oh, Cobra!
Diamond Cobra, the White Fox.
That makes much more sense.
Why is that font on, why is black font on a black background?
I don't know, but let's go watch the movie.
Okay.
"June 20th, BC, Egypt."
Okay.
"Wedding day."
That's a mirror.
It's a glass mirror.
Fluouresent lights.
That's my grandma's glass mirror.
She bought that in the 1970's
It must be worth a fortune, because it's from Ancient Egypt.
Okay, so her friend gave her the magic necklace.
