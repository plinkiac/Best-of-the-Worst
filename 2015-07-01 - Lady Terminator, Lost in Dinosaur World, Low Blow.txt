Jay: Ishtar on VHS? [Looks it over, shakes it, then lets it fall to the ground] Oh my god, it’s the director’s cut of Ishtar on Blu-ray [Drops it, looks at a film reel] And what the fuck? It’s the Ishtar trailer on 35 millimeter?
[Colin opens a door and comes in]
Colin: Heeeey, it’s me, Colin from Canada!
J: Oh, hi, Colin! [Drops the film]
C: Hi, Jay! I saw that you guys broke your Tom Green beer bottle, so I brought you up another one, from the Great White North! [Hands over the bottle]
J: Oh gee, Colin, thanks! [Drops the bottle] Hey, since you’re here, do you wanna watch some movies?
C: ...Sure!
[Wide panning shot starting on the shelves to the left and ending at Jay and Colin] (?)
J: [Shoves the tape in Colin’s face] So, Colin, what’s our first movie?
C: First up is Lady Terminator. “She slays anyone in her way!” [Plays Lady Terminator title card/animation] There’s like 5 of her on the cover
J: That’s like the, uh, uh, Blood Debts guy, how he has multiple arms
C: “Explosive action and steamy romance crash head-on into this thrill-a-minute story of a temptress seeking revenge for a century-old betrayal. The South Sea Queen was a sensual beauty with an insatiable appetite for sex. Finally bested by her--hun--[Chuckles]--one-hundredth husband, Elias” [Jay laughs] This is not what I expected. “Her one-hundredth husband, Elias…”
J: When does Arnold Schwarzenegger in female form show up?
C: I--I have no idea

[1:43] [In the screening room]
Rich: She does so many kegels that she is able to crush his penis? [Jack laughs] To death
Jack: Nice
Mike: Rich, how do you know the word “kegel”?
[In the VHS room]
C: “She swore revenge on his great-granddaughter. 100 years later, an anthropology student named Tanya is possessed by the queen and sets out to fulfill the curse. Dressed in black leather…” of course, “sporting a machine gun, she stalks the streets, seducing and destroying new lovers as she searches for Elias’ descendant, a pretty rock singer named Erika

[2:18] R: I kind of like that this is like a desperate editing attempt to fix a boring movie

[2:29] C: Um, so, “Erika has a sacred dagger that can destroy Tanya.” Uhh
J: Oh, we got sacred daggers now, huh? (?)
C: “And a tough cop who thinks the legend is a silly superstition. Until Tanya litters the streets with mangled bodies and turns him into a believer”
J: Nothing about what you just described makes any sense to me
C: Nope!
J:....Okay!
(...)
J: We should point out we do have a second copy of Lady Terminator, and the VHS rental sticker says it belongs on the bottom shelf, “worst of the worst”
C: So then it’s decided, we don’t even need to--to watch it
J: Uh, yeah, we can just destroy it right now, I guess
C: Sweet! Sounds good [Jay lets the tape drop]
(...)
J: So, our next...possible movie? Is Lost in Dinosaur World
*Lost in Dinosaur World*
J: This is not even on the IMDB. We could not find any information on this. We don’t even know for sure if it’s a film. Uh, but we’re gonna--we’re gonna try Lost in Dinosaur World [Reads the back] “A beast is stirring” [Colin snorts] Why is that funny? That’s terrifying
C: Hmm mhm hmm
J: Did you see Jurassic World? It was the most intense, scary movie [Rotten Tomatoes scores appear]
C: No
J: Oh ok
C: No
J: “The sky’s growing dark. Strange animal sounds fill the air...and the thundering footsteps of a tyrannosaurus rex are getting closer and closer. You are lost in Dinosaur World™”
(...)
J: “Embark on a trip that detours through danger when Tim and Mary McDunn get separated from their parents on a visit to Dinosaur World. The only place on Earth where dinosaurs live, breathe, and eat……..Their compass is broken, and it is getting dark. Will Tim and Mary make it out before nightfall? The hungry tyrannosaurus rex hopes they don’t!”
(...)
J: Uh, “the amazing Dinomation….” registered trademark, “Dinosaurs make this live action DVD--” they don’t even call it a movie, it’s just a DVD, “a spectacular adventure where towering dinosaurs roam free, just as they did millions of years ago, except that now, you are there. Edge-of-your-seat excitement featuring the Dinomation Dinosaurs registered trademark”
C: Wait, is that--they’re saying that? So that’s not a quote from somebody who’s seen it at the end?
J: Nope! Our only hope is that if it is not an actual movie, it’s short
C: Okay

[6:20] J: So, Colin, what’s our last film?
C: Our last film is....[Chuckles] Low Blow. “The deadliest weapon is still your fist.” And...and my, what a fist he has [Low Blow title card appears] “Play by the rules and you will lose!”
J: Well, that’s unfortunate
C: Wait, “he’s Leo Fong, a martial arts experts who holds the explosive power of lightning in his hands. Lethal weapons ready to strike at a moment’s notice [Turns the tape over] That’s Leo Fong?
(...)
C: “Fong answers the call to battle as the streets of San Francisco explode with action. Troy Donahue--Cameron Mitchell! [Clapping sound effect plays] And…”
J: Cameron Mitchell is our mascot, even if he’s let us down…
C: Yeah, yeah
J: Most...more often than not lately
C: “And Akosua Busia (The Color Purple) star in this searing thriller from the makers of Killpoint”

[7:45] J: The music just starts before we even see action is happening
R: [Laughs] He knows--that’s how he knows, he hears the music

[7:55] C: “When a wealthy businessman needs to rescue his daughter from the grasp of a mind-controlling cult, he knows who to call....Leo Fong! Fong wastes no time in assembling an awesome display of firepower, recruiting an underworld all-star team featuring the toughest vigilantes and mercenaries ready to do battle. With a ruthless array…” and then, I can’t read anything else ‘cause it has the Blockbuster, uh, sticker on it
J: [Sighs loudly then shakes his head] Blockbuster ruined everything
C: Something, something, something, “they….Low Blow!” [Jay laughs] And the picture on the back is amazing because it’s got, I’m assuming that’s Leo Fong, and he’s punching somebody, and it makes it looks like, uh, that he punched his head off
J: If--if--no--I--it--that’s not--clearly that’s not what’s happening in that picture, when you look closely, but I do hope that somewhere in the movie he punches somebody’s head off. Or I will be disappointed
C: Yeah. [Points at the guy on the cover] Do you think he’s gonna have an oversized prosthetic hand for the entire movie?
J: He’ll be wearing, like, those foam Hulk hands [Colin laughs] Just one, though
C: Just painted...just painted flesh color
J: Yeah. Low Blow
C: Low Blow

[9:11] J: Stunt driver Cameron Mitchell

[11:21] [After one of the queen’s lovers dies]
C: Uh, he dies, hundredth husband comes in, immediately afterwards she needs more sex, and then in the middle of having sex…
JK: As women do, am I right? [Holds his hand up for a high five] [Laughs] Am I right? No? Okay [Looks down]
[Silence]
J: [Turns towards Colin and Rich] Who invited him?
R: [Sadly] I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never had a woman [“Confirmed for virgin” appears over Rich]

[14:16] JK: Oh, he’s getting a really bad Yelp review

[16:06] J: Oh yeah, that’s the Terminator scene, it’s just like in Terminator, at the Griffith Observatory, when Arnold’s walking up naked to the punks when--
C: She comes out of the sea
J: She comes out of the sea, she walks up to the punks, it’s the exact same setup, only here she just fucks ‘em...because
C: Yes
JK: To death!
J: Fucks ‘em to death
C:...wearing like, the same outfits as, like, Bill Paxton
R: Could--it could be worse, I mean, it could’ve been Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to fuck you [Colin and Jay laugh]
J: Bill Paxton. Poor Bill Paxton
C: Ohhh
R: [As Arnold] “Give me your clothes. Then bend over”
J: And he’s like “game over, man!”

[16:42] JK: What we started to realize, midway through the movie, is they were taking chunks of the movie from later on, and just somehow--er--er--for some reason just moving them to the front of the movie... 
C: Yeah
J: But then repeating it later on in the order they’re supposed to be
JK: Yes
C: So you’d see an action scene (?) like a mall shootout….uhh, and then....
J: And then her walking down that one air--that--that low angle shot of her walking that was used 150 times
C: Yeah, you’d have to do a count to see, I’m pretty sure it’s actually 150 times
R: I’m--I commend them for that [Jay laughs] You could’ve ended up with a situation like The Tomb where the--it’s just hours of people talking, and somebody, the person editing this realized, “oh God. This is horribly boring. I’m just gonna take that action scene from the end of the movie and I’m just gonna put it here”

[21:25] JK: The car that is, at one point in the movie, literally stronger than a tank
J: Yeah [Overlapping dialogue] Yeah, the tank keeps hitting it
C: They shot it with missiles twice
J: [Huffs] Well, technically it was only once because it was the same footage used twice
[Plays clip]
C: What is this car made of?! [Jay laughs]
[Silence]
R: Automantium
M: Ohh, ohhh
[Rich and Jack high five]
JK: You nailed it, Rich
M: Pretty good
JK: You nailed it

[23:16] R: I think the editor was just trying to get fired

[25:06] Ticket Salesperson: Welcome to Dinosaur  World!
R: “I hate my life!”

[25:46] Kid: Yeah. So let’s go find some dinosaurs
JK: That’s a dinosaur
J: That is a dinosaur
JK: You dickhead kid

[26:24] R: And then the kids get lost at night, because they’re idiots. And then--and then they find them after nothing exciting happens
C: They’ll be running from a tyrannosaurus rex puppet who can, like, barely movie its head
J: [Makes grinding machine noises] You can hear the animatronics, like--grrrr
C: You can see the smoke from the animatronics at some point in the…
J: It’s malfunctioning!
R: It wasn’t the--it wasn’t the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, it was arthritis 

[30:38] JK: Here’s the most important part, I think that this is one of the best movies we’ve ever watched on Best of the Worst, because it was 25 minutes long [Colin laughs]
R: Oh, that’s bullshit! [Pause] That’s--that’s bullshit. That’s--that's a funny joke, once or twice...no, no
J: I think it’s always true, though, that’s the thing. The shorter the movie, the better it is
R: Would you--would you say it was more entertaining than Lady Terminator?
J: No! But it was shorter. That trumps everything, Rich
R: Which would you rather watch again?
J: [Points to Lost in Dinosaur World] This ‘cause it’s shorter!
C: No...no…
R: You’re a madman. [Jay laughs] You’re a madman
C: Well, there was a point where we said, it was like, kind of fifteen minutes in, you know, like, “God, it’s...this feels like a feature length film”

[33:05] R: He’s like the main character from Miami Connection after 30 years of crippling depression

[36:09] J: I--I do like when Cameron Mitchell was--was getting intimate with a lady, he still kept his robe and his sunglasses on [Everyone laughs]
C: But it was just the robe, it wasn’t attached to anything
J: No, no, it was just the hood
[In the screening room]
R: He’s just wearing the hood [Jay and Colin laugh] He’s just wearing the hood…
M: He has a different sleeping outfit
C: This is his sex robe [Laughter] Ugh
JK: What?!
[Rich laughs]
[Back at the table]
JK: “This is my sleeping hood. Like momma used to wear”
R: So you know he’s the bad guy, who’s a hoodlum [Background music stops, everybody stares at Rich or glances around] What?

[37:52] C: He was just like a black hole of charisma
J: He cared so little that he didn’t even care about his driving
R: That was the best part of the movie
J: It was, once we realized that, well, at first we weren’t sure if it was a running gag, and then it just kept happening
C: Yeah. His bad driving...although he is Chinese
JK: [Shakes his head] No
R: You sicken me

[40:38] C:...he kept sort of showing up in these scenes, and then sort of watching these fighters, so they had these two kind of, uh, Latino guys, like, sort of knife fighting in the streets, as they do [Jack and Jay raise their eyebrows and look at the camera] Uh, I don’t know
J: [Whispers] Oh my God
R: Check your privilege 

[42:03] M: His head turned into a cake

[46:12] C: It’s true, do you think the car’s a character, like, he stole every scene he was in [Everyone chuckles] Low Blow is just his partner
JK: Yeah, oh, it’s a buddy cop movie, Low Blow and his trusty car
C: Oh, that’s awesome
R: Low Blow, out-acted by a car

[47:00] J: Ok, so we have Lady Terminator...uh…[Picks up the case and looks at it] Lost in Dinosaur World, and Blah blah blah
