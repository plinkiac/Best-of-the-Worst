oh my
it's that magical time of year again

and this looks like we're filming the christmas best of the worst episode where we watch three christmas-themed feature-length films
i'm so excited
you know it's been such a terrible year for so many people
at least we have this to look forward to
ho ho ho
merry christmas mike
why it's my very oldest and dearest friend rich evans
that's right mike
you know we've been doing this show together for a lot of years now
and you know together we've had so many memories and so many times and
oh yes yes
and you know mike through it all you've always been there
and and on this special holiday episode you know i just wanted to show you exactly how much you mean to me
oh rich
thank you so much
does this mean i get to open up the very first feature length christmas themed movie that we're gonna watch today
take it away buddy
oh boy oh boy
this is gonna be the best christmas ever
damn straight it is
what
no nothing
go ahead
open the tape
when you said damn straight it is
like under your breath
because it's such a good holiday
it sounded sinister in nature
no no no
i can't wait to see what movie we're gonna watch
i'm in the christmas spirit
you know
huh
it's just a regular old vhs tape
there's no box
there's no labeling on it
there's nothing on the side
it's just a regular black spine
oh
they're all black spines
but what about
merry christmas [ __ ]
no no no
suck it it's
elves
creep creepy boring and weird
why did that happen
what are you a goddamn nazi or something
is that out yours
[Music]
one two
three santa was really taking a big risk
because she could have
fell back with that chainsaw right in
your face
[Music]
[Applause]
nothing happens we somehow managed to
talk about this thing for four hours
despite the fact that nothing happens
are you done
merry christmas to me indeed
[Music]
no no other people are star [ __ ] they
want to sit next to me
so we watched a whole bunch of other
shitty tapes today and we didn't
see i've been studying because if i took
control
i got to pass off the first couple
videos oh yeah how do we do it when
there's this minute
there's too many i think it's just the
one we unwrapped hey there's eight and
there's four of us we can all do the
math that's two each
so you can't get out of it yeah yeah i
guess it should be
whichever one we unwrapped we talk about
yes
does that make sense sure that makes
sense okay
yeah i guess so yeah it does all right
makes sense
well the first tape is uh it ain't worth
it it ain't worth it it ain't worth it
what is it mike it is uh
sexual intercourse what is it mike
it is a clown named pennywise who
appears
in the bunny dreams
it's somewhere in the background he's
drooling
[Laughter]
over all those delicious children to eat
um you like sex is it worth this thing
we all float out here uh it ain't worth
it is
narrated by a nba basketball player
uh whose name eludes me at this moment
ac green
ac green back when i wasn't paying
attention to sports so i don't know who
that is
but i do know who barry sanders is who
played for the detroit lions who appears
in this video
holding a basketball wearing a
basketball jersey it's all ahead
which momentarily caused my brain to
melt
hi i'm barry sanders of the detroit
lions i want to give you a serious
mountain playing in basketball
otherwise how are you going to run when
i'm on youtube would guess he was a
basketball player if he wasn't holding
the basket he's not he's a football
player
oh was he yeah yeah oh i missed that he
was like one of the best
bags if not the best running game just
wrecked my brain he's like i'm barry
sanders and i'm like
he's like from the detroit lions and i'm
like i'm like i know barry sanders he's
a footballer
that's because whoever made this just
thought they were having basketball
players so when he showed up in the set
those are the basketball props are the
only problems
but it did help in the end with the
slamming
video there was a slamming uh
rap video at the end man i'm through
i'm down with the honeys what the [ __ ]
you're in the middle of the game
it's never happened before it's
unprecedented this is the longest
opening [ __ ] video ever nothing but a
[Music]
joke
oh that's the basketball player rapping
this was a whole front just to
kick-start his rap career
[Music]
i'll bury it but any self-respecting
rapper isn't going to take him seriously
now he's rapping about abstinence the
point of this is
uh we were trying to figure it out while
you're watching it is it abstinence for
jesus or abstinence
for the sake of not getting stds and
unwanted teenage pregnancies
the there was the meter wait wait she
just she just
like like condoms don't do anything
the meters hit going towards jesus sure
that could surprise some people that
that abortion is legal throughout
the whole nine months of pregnancy jesus
jesus jesus jesus
that was going towards jesus or
abstinence for
you know stds and and unwanted
pregnancies
i think it was the the latter the
unwanted pregnancies
we didn't really finish the tape so
we're not 100 sure no we did finish it
we started talking over because it was
the same thing
over and over it was a lot of phony
statistics
there's lots of numbers thrown around
and all of them were incorrect
it's supposed to feel real good you know
but there are some
serious strings attached now if you did
it
you have a 50 50 chance of getting sick
and i mean real sick 50 50.
you called her a headache here no
if you did it a statement not supported
by science
50 everything was fifty percent and did
you know the odds of teenagers getting a
disease like herpes syphilis
gonorrhea chlamydia and worst of all hiv
and aids is around fifty percent
and on top of all of this i don't
believe that's love
she said it twice if you have sex
there's a fifty percent chance you'll
get pregnant
it was a fifty percent chance for
something chance
you're gonna get something bad yeah also
a two-third percent chance you'll get
something bad yeah
first off sex is not
a cool status just because it's not in
your
like checked off column doesn't make you
any less cool yeah it's obvious
i mean they are very well you see lots
of dweebs saying
i don't want to have sex anyway you want
to end up with aids five years down the
line you're 22 years old
and you're dying of age you got sores
and blisters all over your body
you're in the bed you're having people
change you every day you can't even move
i think i i'd rather have fun just wait
until i get married
don't fool yourself yeah they're not
come on uh well okay the big question is
i think the video i don't know who made
it who made it let's see
the subject is sex that's right here we
go the
s word s-e-x this is absolutely a
christian thing
this is dave robinson the san antonio
spurs before you make a mistake
wait and think no i don't think it is
hi i'm barry sanders of the detroit
lions i want to give you a serious
message about safe sex
yeah i'll tell you i'll tell you why
okay go ahead
if you're a christian and you want to
spread the message to schools
public schools about abstinence
you can't put a video in public schools
that says jesus says you can't have sex
jesus jesus jesus
so you just leave jesus out of it and
just say
don't have sex because i had drugs or
anything because that is the point of
this video is not be responsible the
point of this video is don't have sex
ever under any circumstances yeah if
this were a video that we're just
concerned about
children uh teenagers getting stds
then they would say here's how you
properly use a condom
not condoms never work you can't use
that just don't have sex well
50 of the time they don't yeah 50 of the
time
you have a 50 50 chance of getting sick
with with
what we're talking about pregnancies
right unwanted pregnancies adults
using condoms yes [ __ ] up 10 to 15
of the time right condoms fail to
prevent pregnancy approximately 15
per year among adults like uh the condom
fell off or it broke or whatever con
adults are are incompetent
when you go to teenagers or adolescents
double that number they're they're
doubly as incompetent as far as
the condom fell off or broke goes up to
36 percent
the 50 50 odds were when you have
sex that's all they said when you have
sex you are
50 you have a 50 50 chance of getting
aids
gonorrhea syphilis or chlamydia now they
didn't say
any other details with that 50 50 odds
how many sexual partners you have in one
evening
uh how whether or not you have
protection
or not you know it's just if you have
one sexual partner a year
50 50 odds of getting gonorrhea probably
not
45 sexual partners an evening
they're still 50 50 odds they didn't
explain it they just said 50
they just threw out numbers to scare you
flip it in the air
heads you don't catch a disease or get
pregnant tails you do
just to scare you and then the girl
brought out a quarter and said watch me
flip this quarter is it heads or tails
tails you got gonorrhea heads
you got gonorrhea for simplicity's sake
she should have brought out a 50 cent
piece
because 25 i think 25 you know yeah
if you get the jfk site up you've got
all the stds
[Laughter]
hi i'm daryl green of the washington
redskins hey y'all let me tell you the
real truth about abstinence
all right one down nobody has anything
else to say about that safe right
no no absolutely not other than slamming
and they should have said knock in boots
more it was like they should they didn't
say nothing about it
i guess that's the one thing to point
out that the video aesthetically is
the most 90s knock the boots
it was filmed the week before knocking
the boots ooh
boy it's like this would have been great
a week ago
although that's a very pro-sexual song
true
but it's like that but it's freezing
it's just to make sure that
everybody on the hip know that sex
ain't that great you got to be down low
with the kids
yeah yeah you don't want to reference a
song that that glorifies
sex end up not gonna wait wait
wait just wait
until you're married just don't have sex
ever until you're married until you're
married and you want to have children
it's the only time you should ever have
sex ever
they needed to play sex is miserable by
johnny cash
i went up like a classic
this song is a very personal thing i
suppose you might say but it's
the way i feel about a lot of things
[Laughter]
it's miserable time it's a b-side right
and then they're just cuts of like the
hip-hop teens and they're just
who's this old man singing the song the
new hot single i had sex
and it wasn't that good
they should interview teens who've just
had tons and tons of casual sex without
consequences
you're saying let's see that's i wore a
condom
that's a companion video it was worth it
it's over there look at me i'm doing
fine
memories to last a lifetime
oh y'all having sex right now and it
feels great y'all are suckers
santa what's the next tape yeah okay
somebody has to hand it
it's all the way over there oh
second chance versus magnum force yeah i
need who often is rich
bridge dude yeah yeah yeah no this is
this is this is my
my my presence this is the creme de la
creme this is yeah we peaked early
tonight
anyway we'll crank off a little bit of
the m60 here
this is my present to myself this is
your presence
my god our second tape was
second chance versus magnum
force which oh god this was magical it
was just a magical moment in history
richard richard davis is a man rich
davis
rich davis who was it was roger ebert
in disguise
[Laughter]
twinge of john candy and rick moran
visually john candy meets eric mirandas
purpose of what i'm trying to illustrate
to you here today
uh is uh to show you
uh to show you yeah
his voice i think you figure it out like
halfway through the tape
identical to roger ebert but the car the
tire does not explode like you see in uh
it kind of sounds like roger ebert
traditionally held in the movies
you know yeah
uh 56 pounds of beef that corresponds to
i don't know what five or six year old
kid i'm gonna love hearing these voices
side by side
i hate it hated hated this movie that's
a statement i made many times while
leaving the screening room and now here
for a bullet to have enough energy to
physically
knock a human being backwards ourselves
my intelligence and my patience
and you can't get away from it oh yeah i
know you're gonna do that of course
so so second chance versus magnum force
is an amazing
amazing tape made by this man called
richard davis and this tape it's
basically a
a gun bulletproof vest video
he's selling his products but he didn't
think that was enough
to make the video entertaining so he
interspersed it with
uh dramatic recreations
oh my god not uncle phil
and hilarious comedy skits it's it's a
gun enthusiast variety show
yeah it's almost like for goodness sake
we've got we've got uh uh real life
testimonials
uh we've got comedy skits
uh and we've got a lot of just
gun porn yeah yeah a little bit of gun
porn the guy
the guy real quick the guy invented the
kevlar vest
1975 he shot himself in the chest with a
gun
to show how in fact effective his his
kevlar vest was
and this isn't in the video this is not
the video he does shoot himself
in the video he developed it because
when he was a pizza boy he got mugged
and he blew the [ __ ] who mugged him
away
with his [ __ ] magnum and he thought
well gee
wouldn't it be nice if i had a
bulletproof vest yes but we're also
speculating that since he was a us
marine
perhaps he had served in a war maybe
vietnam
and saw many of his friends and and you
know comrades die
and he said gee i wish my comrade would
have had
a kevlar vest on who got shot and
or stabbed by a bayonet by the those
filthy viet cong
and then he said i'm gonna go in in
between delivering pizzas i'm going to
invent
the kevlar best and he did
and to prove that it worked this man
[ __ ]
shot himself yeah
oh boy oh boy oh my god
oh my god
oh easy as pie guys
he'd love to debunk like movie style
car explosions which had to get into a
bunch of [ __ ]
with the bulletproof vest we're going to
try to do now is dispel some
misconceptions people have
about what handgun boats and even
shotguns for that matter will do it to a
running automobile
yeah that's how the video starts is him
shooting a car
until the interior catches on fire which
i don't think that's realistic either
but it happens no it's re it's real
interesting it must be real because it
happened in the video i think he
i think he has a weird heart on for guns
and that's okay
that's that's a pretty good assumption
that opening though was amazing because
he has his grandmother's cadillac out
there and he's like
we didn't even know what the video was
about at this point it just cuts to it
just starts with him
shooting a car it starts with like
random skits of like
judges letting prisoners on the streets
everybody should just do anything wrong
just let him out on the street he hasn't
raped anybody in five years
this inmate hasn't committed any armed
robberies rapes or murders in the last
five years
yeah that's because we've had his rotten
ass locked up for the last five years
yeah he's perfectly cool
well i don't know about that uh but the
prison is overcrowded and we've got 10
win mates coming in tomorrow
he has like a handful of machine guns
and he's like ah and then he moves up to
like the 50 caliber
like he's like uh well if you have a
bulletproof vest on this isn't gonna
help
but i might as well shoot up my
grandmother's catalog
well he's like if you happen to run into
a thug or a terrorist
like what are you gonna be walking
around he's basically saying you can
walk around with a gun like that but
your aim is going to be terrible
a weapon we hope you will never have to
face as a law enforcement officer is a
belt-fed machine gun
if you ever should have to run into a
big time terrorist drug smuggler
whatever
with one of these there's uh
not too much you can do except kill them
yeah but here it is on a on a tripod
just for fun let's get on this car
shoot this car up and you see the tracer
bullets like and he's like
just nailing this car with six caliber
bullets and i was like this is
this is amazing it's [ __ ] awesome it
is awesome
again the best way to uh get the tracer
bullets and everything i hope the whole
video is him just shooting cars
wow
[Laughter]
the other uh only other weak point is
when you you pick this up you want to
talk like hey yo
adrian hey anyway this is the wrong
stallone movie
yeah [ __ ] that car yeah
what the [ __ ] was that not the greatest
comedian
even though he started the video with
it's like comedy
this is what funny is oh yeah yeah yeah
it's like the the webster's dictionary
defines comedy as
and then someone puts a pie in his face
yeah yeah that's
a couple pieces it's pretty high brow
stuff
i mean he's studied from the best he's
clearly not a
comedian nor a ladies man
oh no i don't know he is he is because
he knows how to act
in front of a young woman in a plastic
bag
hello i'm the man of your dreams i've
come to take you to las vegas
you know we could go to las vegas i'll
tell my wife uh we're going on a
you know he's a pretty manly man he
can't live 350 pounds
[Laughter]
survivalist ebert this is just him
showing off that he can lift weights
what does this have to do with that
joint six times if i really wanted i am
stronger than most
wow he makes sure you know that how many
times did he lift it
and then how long did it he did it three
times
and then he put a text on the bottom of
the screen that said i could have done
it since
however much weight it was he was
[ __ ] uh out of breath for the next 10
minutes
he he [ __ ] pressed like four times
he's just like
he then set it down it's like now i'm
going to carry you
in fact second chance soft body armor
has had approximately 200.
he's out of breathe stronger than most
you can cut you can cut you know wait a
few minutes yeah you do a second take
but that segment that whole segment he
lifts the weights he can't breathe for
15 minutes
and then uh his sexy assistant comes on
repeatedly young laura dern that's her
first acting it's it's laura dern and
every time he does like a
whoo pop girl has like multiple things
he licks his lips
yeah thank you thank you thank you
thank you very much indeed oh boy and
then one time she decides she just
doesn't want to come out so they just do
an awkward uh
jump cut i don't think he was willing to
trust her with his
with his beloved katana that's a man's
weapon
it can't be yeah it can't be sullied by
a woman touching it
she might have attacked them with them
in order to escape
the feminist thought police show up and
they take care of this whole incident
we're the feminist thought police
feminist thought police
that's right we're clairvoyant feminists
who can read sexist thoughts
you can you can read your mind yes we
can this girl is 12
because after one too many
from our host the feminist thought
police come in
yeah after he was literally beating his
meat
hacking is neat hacking his meat hard
other other punishments what are their
punishments this
oh why are you dressed like that
wow to please men
we'll have to re-educate you come with
me
wow wow yes
well let me just say the video had a
format
that we got used to yeah it was boom
boom boom boom boom boom
boom boom boom it was uh guy come
man richard davis comes out and start
and shoots guns at a car
followed by officer so-and-so
was was in this real-life line of duty
thing where he happened to be wearing a
a protective kevlar vest
second chance second chance vest
complete with reenactments
kurt you okay man i'm okay man he just
dust did you get him i don't know man i
don't know
all these different scenarios from a guy
two guys shooting
him in the back with shotguns to like a
punk rock
guy trying to go to a punk rock concert
yeah
next segment comedy here's how
uh so and so so and so view police
officers and it was
teens getting pulled over for driving
one mile over the speed limit
cops in a doughnut shop
uh couple of donuts and the best one of
all
well that was exciting sir i'm sure
that's not funny
oh my god left his tinkles oh no
what happened there well some
kids stole a couple magazines
from a shop from a from a like uh
like a gas station or like near 7-eleven
or any type of uh
little kids stole comic books from a gas
station a gas station they run and they
hide in their fort
yep and shooting fake guns and they're
like yeah we got everything yeah
yeah yeah yeah their children's play
fort yes their children's play for it
their guns are orange and they're just
like capping off
uh and then they go in there to
momentarily
later get surrounded by cop cars
and cops with shotguns and
ballistics and grenades
to [ __ ] take care of them surrounded
implies there was a standoff the cops
just get out of their car
and start plugging away at these kids
and these kids are in there for all we
know just being like oh this is freaking
awesome you see that bra
available for all right ben
let him have it oh my god
[ __ ] god this is
you could see how much fun those guys
were having they're just like yes
they're in there right that's it that's
it yeah
i mean what choice do the cops have
really they stole comic books
there's a fair bit of cringe mixed in
here this is the type of scene we need
paired next to an actual scene where a
cop talks about how he was almost killed
in the line of duty where we see actual
photos of his shoulder
where he got shot in the neck these
scenes go perfectly together
there's one there's one thing that
worries me because like full disclosure
this is two hours long and we had like
15 tapes
so we only watched half of the video
where does it go
after this and there's a part of me
that's afraid his like political views
are gonna get increased increasingly
crazier as it goes on
i'm afraid like the next skit's gonna be
how the jews view police officers
yeah you're right we didn't full
disclosure we didn't watch the whole
tape
we do not endorse any of this man's
stuff so if if he starts endorsing like
white genocide ideas near the end of
this
we don't know yeah we don't know we
stopped we just thought it was funny
when he got a pie in the face okay give
us a break
also at the end of each year
of his life he shoots himself
to remind himself that he is here for a
reason
this is the uh somewhere between 130th
140th time
that i've been shot on second chance
soft body armor hope it's not the last
the guy knows his stuff he knows about
ballistics he knows about guns
we're using the uh two and three quarter
inch double o buck magnum that's 12
pellets of
33 caliber each and it's all it was all
very interesting to me
and i know this stuff isn't funny but i
find it interesting oh no
and and the guy explaining i wish the
video had more of that
again winchester typical 38 125 grain
hollow point 38 from a four inch barrel
we're gonna see what this will do to the
the door of a pickup truck and i'm not
sure what it'll do really
less of the comedy bits and more of him
firing a 50-caliber machine gun
at his mother-in-law's car because
he's crazy but he knows his [ __ ]
sure and on top of it all he sounds like
roger ebert
which makes it he loves shooting cars oh
my god
and reacting to long-legged ladies
what we're saying is this guy's the
complete package so
ladies except for looks
if you're looking for a man maybe hit
him up that's all i'm saying i'm a real
man's man like a real
real man's man in every department
except for
uh physical and personality another 200
special automobile we got some tires uh
using 38 specials here
and uh something i frankly i've never
done before i want to see what the
38s will do to uh tires will they blow
them yeah
like you see in the movies we'll try it
here goes for the rear one
but but also yeah well like when he's
debunking like hollywood myths
about like he's like well if you shoot a
this car is running right now and i'm
going to shoot the engine block
we're going to try to do now is dispel
some misconceptions people have
about what handgun boats and even
shotguns for that matter will do it to
a running automobile it doesn't always
blow up
he's like that's like a one in a million
shot right you have to do this this and
this in order to make the engine blow up
he's like well i i ended up stalling the
engine because i
he killed the ignition switch yeah and
and then he's like shooting the tires
like what does this have to do with your
kevlar vest
the point of the video is to sell his
product but then he just threw all this
other stuff in
for a goof yeah for fun started one
lucky shot got in there and clipped
clipped the fuse wire or clipped the
destroyed the whole fuse
system here wherever this thing is so
there's not much left of it
what does this have to do with body
armor this whole point was you can't
stop a running car
with a handgun and then he stopped
running car with his handgun on accident
well this is the long version yes which
means there's a shorter version i'm
assuming his
his business partners edited all of that
[ __ ] out
that part where you take a samurai sword
to a slab of beef
why don't we cut that richard do you
really think we need that part where the
cops
murder all those children god damn yes
we do
we're trying to sell a product that's
why i'm making the segment with the
children
like now learning about this video what
does
a bullet shot feel like if you're
wearing a vest
getting poked by a pool cue yeah just a
poke and that's what makes you put your
foot on that gas pedal and run that
and run down that that filthy the punk
that filthy uh new order fam uh
they wanted to go see poison and mom
dropped them out
at the corner of highway 33 and
terrestrials i'm going to town today
and they got dropped for somebody [ __ ]
you i'm just gonna shoot a random car
that depeche mode fan fires two shots
through your windshield you hit the gas
all bets are off you know
oh my god yeah yeah
did you check on him when he was going
to work to see if he had his vest on not
before he
got shot i used to think he was silly
sometimes for wearing it to court and
stuff but
i would never let him go out of the
house now without one it's like i got
shot yeah i used to make fun of my
husband leaving the house when he wore
his
bulletproof vest but then one day he did
get shot i
just wanted to make a baby how old's
that baby
10 months old when he got shot eight
months ago
nine months and one day
i figured hey you know it's like i was
wrong about cheating
can i shoot you each year like rich does
oh my god
richard davis if you let me shoot you
each year like rich davis does himself
i will let you poke me forever
[Laughter]
56 pounds of beef that corresponds to i
don't know what five or six year old kid
merry christmas to me indeed
how to carve great faces for halloween
perfect timing it's an appropriate
holiday
um thanks for having me here
how to carve great faces for halloween
1988 same year oh yeah
yeah it was a banner year for crazy men
being chess
cameras giant glasses
this was like the plateau when it comes
to these weird videos where it's like
this is when the most were produced
and then it was all downhill after that
we've got a nice little five pound
pumpkin here
and the first thing we have to do is get
the top off
so why did your wife leave you
and they want a great big huge knife
and how did she die
how to carve great faces for halloween
uh 30 minutes 1988 gordon falk
they call him gordy gordy which i guess
if his real name is gordon falk then
it's just a coincidence that he loves
pumpkins
that's a coincidence there's a big word
that is
not right here and that is great
um they should be how to carve faces
for halloween but then they would have
to say
faces into pumpkins one of the
gourd families and then they're like
that's not gonna fit on a
vhs tape how how to slap together a
video in an afternoon when you're drunk
on pbr
that should be the name of the video
they got it and so
basically this man shows us how to
carve pumpkins the best way he knows how
which is whatever knife you have in your
drawer
in your drawer if it's bendy
and like if you have one to fight a
polynesian
army or anything
they reach in the drawer and pull out
something that you could probably win
the peloponnesian wars with
uh mr gord gordon falk aka gordy falk
he stands outside of his home and it's a
stone building and it looks like
like a house you'd see in wauwatosa
wisconsin sure and so i was like
okay i'm so embarrassed another
midwestern
drunken man with giant glasses in 1988
is making a video
i carve between 500 and 800 different
pumpkins
every halloween so that's about three
four thousand pumpkins
in the last eight years that's a good
part of what makes the video
entertaining
it's it's that accent the uh the
lameness
of the entire concept of the video which
is like
he's this like middle-aged man that's
just like i've been carving 500 pumpkins
every year for the last 40 years
and you see his kitchen and it's just
surrounded by pumpkins yeah
it's the saddest thing i've got so much
experience
i'm going to show you how to make a
terribly average pumpkin yeah
which is which is exactly how you would
figure to do it on your own even without
this tape
yeah yeah it's like the most common
sense pumpkin carving you would
like if someone's gonna make a video
like i'm gonna show you how to carve
faces into pumpkins
you would expect something with a little
more artistry to it a little more
craftsmanship something a little more
complex
you want to make sure that the
top when it rests these pumpkins are
terrible
that's why i held on to this
they're not good this is the face
that you carved
harold you suck
i always think about those pumpkins that
they show like i don't know when you
watch like football around like
thanksgiving time
and they bring in like the professional
like pumpkin carvers oh sure
and there are like details like you know
like aaron rodgers face
like throwing the footballs and it looks
like like like a photograph
and they're like [ __ ] perfect yeah
and then you look at
this guy carves triangles and he can't
even follow him
what we're going to do there is give
this guy big white nostrils what
what the why why would you do that
why courtney courtney what are you doing
hey
[Music]
and then the pumpkins in the background
look like like like six-year-olds
and then he's he's and his is
his tips are okay like remember he's
like
don't when you curve and take out the
top part right don't do it perfectly
right because keep it underneath it's
gonna 45 degrees 45 degree angle and
then he had a tip where you cut the butt
off the pumpkin
if you wanted to like sit straight that
was the one good thing that was
a lot of stuff and he's like okay well
okay you have this kind of knife right
the the short little knife
this knife is a fruit knife
it's sharpened on both sides it is very
narrow
but he's like also open up your knife
drawer and you've got 11
other knives that are all like one
millimeter thick
and and and so nobody has those knives
cordy
what are you talking about what is the
name of that well he doesn't specify
what type of knife is there he's just
like this one's kind of bendy or
there's the weird weird short knife that
is really short and curved
like nobody has that this is as good as
any
we'll get rid of some of these pieces
just throw them on the ground
he doesn't even look
[Laughter]
but now is the moment where i'm by
children and they have this one knife
unless you have that like kids carving
knife where it's like serrated
every person in in the whole world is
just using a steak knife
because they just don't care yeah
they're doing two triangles
and a smiley face and then they're done
maybe with a lazy tooth
one one random one like crazy
raisy tooth
now rich yeah i haven't carved a pumpkin
since i was five
and and i know you've personally carved
pumpkins for our halloween episodes of
best of the worst
and you've done a bang-up job thank you
how do you how do you
rate gordy's advice and especially his
is you are just an average man you're
just rich evans right yeah
gordy claims to be a pumpkin carving
expert actually
your pumpkins are lightyears
beyond the man who has made the
instructional tape what
how what are your thoughts on this video
my my thoughts were i i didn't need a
tape because
that's all [ __ ] i just thought to do on
my own
never having carved pumpkin before at
all like best of the worst i never
never did that growing up never had any
few years like you carve a pumpkin i
just
i just i gotta carve a pumpkin what
would i do i'll just get a knife okay
well his vice it's a completely useless
tape
another thing the size of the candle
you use should fit the pumpkin
this should be like a netflix show like
a new netflix game show
drunk that's pumpkin bad that's not bad
yeah
it's a good picture carved it drunk and
knives don't go together
gordy does it just fine just fine this
was this was the perfect video
in terms of uh comedic value and length
it wasn't too long where's your lab coat
yeah if you were yeah if you were to do
like
statistics of what makes the perfect uh
wheel of the worst or junka video
our black spine video it's perfect it's
absolutely perfect
and we'll put a cat in here
[ __ ] a
[Laughter]
the one question i have about gordy falk
right
i think i joked that gordy was carving
pumpkins as part of
therapy for his post-traumatic stress
disorder
um because he's like he's like uh i
gotta carve two thousand pumpkins in
in 24 hours and we're like that's why
they all look terrible
and we're like why is he carving two
thousand pounds aren't
yeah yeah i imagined his kitchen his
kitchen is filled with pumpkins
everywhere right
and then it's like it's like he's like
he's like rambling and he's wearing like
the clark griswold
like like what is he doing with these
thousands of pumpkins
he's trying to distract himself from how
miserable he is because his wife left
him and took the kids
okay that that's fine is he is he
distributing them throughout the
neighborhood like
no we see the outside of his house it's
just at the end of the video
stacked everywhere does he carve
pumpkins because she left him
or did she leave him because he carves
pumpkins oh that's the chicken in the
egg question
i'm thinking it's a it's a depressing
coping mechanism okay
so she left him for other reasons
alcoholism perhaps
but it's like if she did leave and he
does this to get attention
he's doing a very good job not due to
the video but
if anybody's in his neighborhood they
know that this house is eventually going
to have
800 [ __ ] lit up pumpkins
in front of his house that's the house
with the pumpkins deer across the street
just walk on the far side of the street
watch it
like take a quick picture but get the
[ __ ] out of there because
he's gonna come for you and we're ready
to take out the insides
some people would rather someone's
coming out god damn it
what are you doing in my house harold
who are you stop where'd all these
pumpkins come from
pumpkin videos where's my cat
here's one you can see
it's got a little few blemishes etc when
we picked this one out earlier
it was full of black dirt the best place
for the face is generally
opposite the part where the pumpkin oh
i needed that video to learn that not
the part that was
facing around don't carve face on side
of pumpkin that looks like
your crap all right jay you're up okay
go with this one it doesn't have a bow
bow
no bow
oh true black spot completely blank
but it's very light that's short that's
good news
and away we go
you're just about there now i hope
you're not too excited about this place
might need a lot of work we're not not
excited
this will be our first real clubhouse
oh my god jay the fourth blank
video is small
change oh my god change small change
oh small change it's gonna be hard for
me to talk about because it's a very
short video and i
left the room for two minutes and i
missed the entire thing
then the total would be four plus eight
or twelve dollars
what else do we need tax
don't confuse the children
it's a very poorly animated video about
something
yeah it's got creepy animation everybody
looks wrong
um they're all cartoon potatoes
[Laughter]
well it's a little blonde kid looks like
he's just in shock
they all walk like this jay that
presumes they walk
half the time just like this yeah
here let me change some of these coins
into dollars
then you won't have to carry so much
loose change around
but what is the point of the video what
is the purpose i don't know
does anybody know i'm asking rich here's
how you add money
okay it's a it's an older lady a teacher
a mentor adult of some kind and then
four kids
and they all go inside a little house
and they
they like a little clubhouse or
something it looks like a residential
house but i think it's supposed to be a
clubhouse
who knows and they talk about how
they're going to upgrade it they want to
put curtains they want to paint
but in order to do all these things they
need a budget
and then they have coins they talk about
how
to add up all the coins how many boards
will it take you to fix the wall
oh i think two should do it okay if one
board is two dollars
then two boards would be this is like
the boringest video ever
and instead of cartoon form to like make
the kids
interested the actual like like drawings
are
bad yeah you'd think if you're not going
to animate it you could spend more time
on the individual drawings
if it was a book it was a like a five to
ten page long book
pass awesome great this is a [ __ ]
cartoon
yeah crank it up i think it's made for
the educational system
about the the benefits of knowing how to
add up change
don't forget the boards we have to get
to fix the wall
i have some more money at home we can
use that i didn't know the walt disney
company was doing animated
educational videos in the 90s
now the only educational value this
video has is you know
animators show it to their students in
like animation classes
don't do that don't do this don't draw
your
your characters like they're the the
love children of
gary coleman and zelda rubenstein
that's where we ended our screening we
were joking don't have the walk like
this
that they were all they were all
special in some way and then and then
the film ended
when you add all this stuff you get 19
19 are you sure she's right
there gary coleman's children
gary coleman and the the lady from
poltergeist
yes
this house is clean willis
go into the light go into the lights
she's just standing
they just answered the question the girl
is just like
oh university
this is good for college students
in florida
and that was it i don't even know what
happened i left the room and it was over
and just they counted the money yeah
yeah did i miss anything good
no and they didn't say where they got
their money they learned that a dollar
had 100 pennies
it's like everybody has quarters but now
i got seven
dimes and a nickel what the hell does
that make
you're moving too much what oh
[Laughter]
your pinky has to look like a toe
everything's wrong
can you look more deformed can you can
you stuff like a pillow in your cheek
an entire pillow more morbidly deformed
yeah and then talk and then kind of talk
about wow
[Music]
there you go there you go
and that's small change we're done with
that yeah that was my pick
here goes
okay i i i guess it's my turn though
it's your turn
[ __ ] right what you got what you
got what you got
bring it what has santa brought me
brought us
pain pain and mr pain
oh it looks like a develop
your psychic power yes
how can i develop my psychic powers
this video will tell me yeah
in 55 minutes oh my gosh okay
oh god oh actually it's not how to
no it's definitely not a how-to she
doesn't want any
misconceptions here the video officially
titled
develop your psychic powers not how to
or not you can just [ __ ] do it
already
develop yourself if there's no guarantee
on
whether or not you will or won't just
and develop i make no claims
it should say i make no claims but it's
just develop your second power don't you
mean
i make no claims hi i'm whitney burns
this video is produced by tim and eric
hey everybody i don't know if you know
that yeah
it looks like a tim and eric sketch hi
i'm litany burns
see how easily you do it now
[Music]
you don't have a crystal ball you can
use any translucent surface
uh some old lady i'm going to call you
an old lady
she's four years younger than we are so
far years i mean she's she's 40.
not anymore she's 39 and a half and she
looks like she's 78.
uh she's some lady who is in
to develop your psychic powers she's
she's a self-pronounced
psychic slash medium slash uh what are
they called uh
does she even say that she is a psychic
actually no she doesn't she doesn't even
make that claim
she she works at kfc
but she knows when people want the extra
crispy
they don't need gas strangely enough she
holds a drumstick up to her head and
thinks very hard
she knows she knows where her biscuits
are buttered
um and she wanted to make a tape
this is like actually decently produced
well spring media
the physical tape the physical tape
that's yeah um
that's it so this crackpot lady uh is
talking about developing your
psychic powers uh which
looks like it could be an instructional
tape like hey oh do i have psychic
powers
maybe i should watch this tape and learn
how to develop them and she kind of
gives some instruction on how to do it
she's at first it starts off very simple
well first she like pops into the frame
hi
i'm linda burns
i'm terrified i'll help you discover
your own natural psychic talents and use
them
and it made us all laugh because it
looked like it like a tim and eric scott
well she does it multiple times in a row
so pop into frame next shot she pops
into frame again and whoever shot this
whoever was the dp
or whatever was like oh i'm going to do
this thing i'm going to do dutch angles
such a bad i'm going to do this like
like like you know documentary style
like interviewing thing and
it was all bad but she's like okay you
know stretch
the people are green screened onto a
magic eye poster oh was that green
screen
yeah yeah they're sitting on the purple
sponge
she got korean john travolta from saturn
high fever
to show up uh and and
some random black lady and a native
american lady and they're all like
that's why it looks like it's in
eric scotch because they would like drag
weirdos off the street and put them in
their sketches
and she's like okay everybody stretch
first off first things
always stretching it's a good way to
stretch the running time of the video
relax
relax feet on the ground this has
nothing to do with actual psychic powers
it's just a warm-up well there are no
such things there is no such thing as
actual psychic powers it's all made up i
don't know mine
and i'm the guy that believes in ghosts
and i think
this lady's a fraud and i want you to
think of someone you truly love
or something you really love and see
what that feels like in your gut
because some of you don't have someone
she was very careful somebody i know the
viewers of her tape
series are lonely lonely
[Laughter]
i'm thinking of my 12 cats
but then the fun bit that we all
participated in oh yeah
was the five object bit uh
sand dollar scissors rubbly glove
posted posted notes that rubber glove by
the way 15
failure rate if you're an adult
that's pretty good uh post-it notes and
glasses was the giant 80s glasses
that richard richard lewis
and uh
gordy fox
or in their videos yeah so she's like
look at these five objects everyone
remember them in your brain
my assistant off camera is going to
rearrange these objects use your psychic
powers
to figure out what they were and we all
did it and we all failed
no sticky notes
no i think it's like stan dollar
and glasses i know glasses was my last
one
um okay so carol carroll carol
carol baskin carol chatting
okay carol carol baskin and her psychic
powers
uh and then it apparently moves up in
complexity at some point but
i think we were just stopped the video
yeah i don't remember we had
eight tapes together
to pay attention too many tapes and too
much booze
okay let's see the object
oh we're picking an object scissors how
many of you guessed no
if only oj was here he would have
guessed having watched half the tape
i i that was enough for me to have
incorrectly guessed what the next tape
would be
yes that's true but it would have been
the second guess
it would have been amazing if i went
with my second choice
yeah yeah but but i want my first choice
which was
not 90 degrees in the pool
[Laughter]
okay here we go here we go all right
wait no
oh you're gonna die i know i i i'm i
gotta i gotta do the i gotta do the
things i got
feet on the ground hands
releasing my energy
okay yeah rub it on your face just like
you said face yeah
yep now you're gonna try to figure out
what's what's the tape about right
computer training video some okay
someone with computer computer computer
training video okay get
more specific than that how do you how
do i use the computer kind of thing
okay fair enough computer or internet
okay
is it how to open it presents tape your
present
like a [ __ ] there you go
make sure you're no it's the other one i
was gonna say
it is the other one i was gonna save
well you're gonna you wrap these
i know what is it 90 degrees in the pool
what it's all about pool birds
90 degrees that's the other that is
literally the other tape i was thinking
about when i'm thinking i'm gonna i'm
gonna choose one
i know put it in it's okay
that would have been amazing nobody
would have believed it but it would have
been amazing
[Music]
i keep you here for a long 16 because
they like to look at you when they come
home
six five right leg
rocking horse front and back
stay the same we're just gonna add a
quarter turn to the left
to a wide jog ready set
turn never send us workout tapes ever
again
i think i could recreate
it's just the lady outside of the pool
right now
it's which which is uh holy [ __ ] 73
minutes
i mean we watched it there's no way
we're gonna watch the whole [ __ ]
thing
which is a a a workout tape
for doing a workout in a pool
that you can't watch while you're doing
the workout in the pool because you'll
be in the pool
yeah so
presumably you're watching this to do
the exercise
how are you going to watch this at the
pool yes
oculus yes waterproof oculus
very carefully
i'm just i'm just trying to imagine some
schmuck like every time they want to
work out they got to drag their tv
outside and and try to figure out how to
hook up the vcr
get the extension cord or just put it up
against their
the sliding door window would just be
like if it was like
today and you have like like if you're
rich and you have this
like lavish pool outside you have like a
like a flat screen tv
hooked up well sure
okay carol baskin let's let's do it yeah
but
but in 1988 yeah you have to you have
five electrical
outlets and your tv weighs 500 pounds
yeah your tv and you have to roll it on
the cart and it's like teetering on the
edge of your pool and you're
you're trying to dance at your pool and
it's it's very dangerous yeah
the neighbors want to come by and like
some dude is like who took lips behind
you are you
what are you watching on your team oh
you weren't in the room there's a guy
swimming laps like in front of oh yeah
i saw that guy and they have to
awkwardly like zoom in a bit so you know
[ __ ] he's in the frame again sure
so we'll start by trying to concentrate
on being together that guy's like [ __ ]
you
i tried to do my laps [ __ ] you
see him multiple times and it was funny
every time
every time he went past you're like
there he goes again can't they tell him
to stop
we're filming it's a public pool rich
they had three they don't even have
permission to fill three people
well she had she had like a microphone
on that doesn't mean they had permission
well
they rented out one 18th of the pool the
olympic swimming pool
and then they rented out the last lane
and they could only
three extras pendulum side to side
three two turn right
hit that cross country stride nice
i think they made it the gym maybe this
is one of those videos where i don't
know what the purpose is
and that's and the point of watching a
vhs tape on your tv
in your living room about water aerobics
when you're not in the water yeah to
make yourself hate yourself even more
like [ __ ] i got a vhs and now they
expect me to have a goddamn pool
it's like we were saying you get like a
barrel like a jeffrey dahmer type barrel
and fill it with water and you do your
exercises you say jeffrey dahmer type
barrel that's the first i ever heard he
had a giant barrel
he put people in barrels it was on our
side of the couch
you guys missed it that was part of his
whole thing he would get these giant
blue barrels and that's what he put
[ __ ] people in it's drew peterson man
true peterson you're from chicago
i'm waiting he killed his wife lacey
peterson he put her in a barrel and
sunk it in the water oh well no
well okay all right let's talk about
this
there's scott peterson oh that's what
i'm thinking of
there's scott peterson from california
who killed his wife lacey peterson now
hang on everybody
everybody hold on to the table hold on
to the chairs you're sitting in
scott peterson right on christmas day he
killed his wife lacey peterson
in california in illinois there's a guy
named drew peterson 58 year old chicago
suburb police guy who was married
to a younger woman named stacy
peterson no i didn't know there was a
barrel involved in this one
a blue barrel oh my god lacy peterson
scott
peterson scott peterson was just seen
dumping something over the side of the
boat
the blue barrel is drew peterson
in the middle of the night drew peterson
the former
suburban chicago police officer had his
friend come over
and his friend said what do you need me
for drew peterson
this is a nice homicide segment i need
you to help me lift this blue
barrel like a chemical barrel one of
those plastic blue chemical barrels
into my truck and his friend said oh boy
this weighs about the amount
of a body are you sure
right because that story ended
then everybody's like waiting
the machine says you were deceptive why
i have no idea your second wife died
accidentally drowned in a baptist
peterson who let's exhume her body and
make sure she drowned
first on christmas day and 1977
[Music]
i
i'm glad we got this straightened out
do you know how much fun drinking is not
a fast-paced star-studded quiz will let
you know
about responsible drinking from the
anheuser-busch
company who picked this one tim i can't
say
how appropriate this is it's time to
test your knowledge about alcohol and
responsible drinking
play along with our panel of celebrities
on your alcohol iq after mike
rambled on about killers for 45 minutes
oh tim don't do that no you pushed me
oh no you pushed me the tape was a
failure the subject is alcohol
and drinking the thing is mickey dolan's
mickey don't [ __ ] doughy-eyed mickey
dolan's going it's like hey
slashed here like what exactly causes
someone to get drunk
[ __ ] that guy it was funny in the show
shut up out about
hey we're the drunkees
[Laughter]
people say we drunky around rich right i
know
we drunky around rich yeah rich is
helping
drew move that blue barrel in the
morning
completely completely oblivious this
weighs just about about as much as your
wife
so now that we've traced alcohol's path
into the body here comes the next
question
how does it get out
so it's all about telling kids about how
drunking is not cool
or adults or adults i think it's for
adults
that's the weird thing you gotta look at
the crowd because there is a quick
shot to a couple which are like
eighth graders dressed as adults and one
has suspenders this is because they
didn't have enough people to fill the
the
the but the thing is there's only a few
shots where they shoot the teachers
that are the majority uh the majority of
the crowd
are middle-aged kids yeah and
middle-aged like middle school kids kids
hey we're middle-aged kids we are
middle-aged we're middle-aged kids rich
i mean that is appropriate
yeah what do you get to do to [ __ ]
get paid
watch shitty videos rich
i know i'm gonna leave it okay okay
when three out of the four of us
outlived elvis we're middle age
middle school kids about what
is the video about what is the point of
this because i think it's interesting to
know this was made by
anheuser-busch at least they're in the
credits so i think they produced it
it's almost like they're they're trying
to to make it
look like they're they're being
responsible about promoting you like
responsible drinking no look at us we're
we're the good guys wait i'm telling you
a lot of these things are really
surprising
i'm learning a lot i don't know about
anybody else me too yeah
audience are we having fun yet
but at the same time they ain't going to
say nothing negative
about alcohol that's the part that's
missing yes
they're talking they're trying to dispel
myths and rumors via like a fun like
trivia thing
any time you take an alcoholic drink it
kills brain cells true or false
what do you think audience yes
how about false so when you drink like
what's the best thing to do
do you eat a big meal or do you snack or
do you drink water
like like like fun stuff not like oh
how many people die from dui's ever yeah
you know it's not it's not really like
like hard
here are signs that show you have an
alcohol problem right they're not gonna
say that
they don't say if you drink too much
alcohol there's a 50 chance you'll die
or have sex or have sex
[Laughter]
that's a crummy time though why is my
dog looking at me funny
[Laughter]
or my grandma
food in the stomach slows the absorption
of alcohol into the blood this video
about how to be a functioning alcoholic
yes is that why they're interviewing all
these uh all these actors because
they're all
alcoholics but they they interview a
bunch of celebrities in this video
celebrities and it's the most like
pathetic
like crusty old ancient celebrities yeah
i mean it's like artie johnson who is a
guy on
laughing and the second
celebrities are so old they should have
had cleopatra
it's not it's not people that have
continued to be celebrities it's people
that were
briefly known for something at the time
the video was made yes
patrick duffy from dallas julius caesar
jesus christ
nero zero
charles darwin socrates socrates
i mean they were all there sigmund freud
what is a geek
i love having a glass of wine every now
and then
in historic times probably women drank i
don't like this guy
as did men if you went back to early
colonial times
here's what they call hansel can you
just make my lower lip shiner than
everything else
stephen hawking's crossed with colonel
sanders
that's what he looks like we're done
with that video it sucked
like you said at one point it looked
like we were watching robocop it felt
like the
the like satirical yeah use things from
robocop and the reason why we kept it
because we got a lot of [ __ ] well well
was the the purpose of it
was that was it court-ordered as in a
judge said
you know anheuser-busch you are you
yeah so many people are dying drinking
blood
bud light and crashing their cars you
need to make a video
and they're like okay brad don't you
think you've had enough to drink tonight
at least this is a party that's what i
came here to do or their
you know their political influences in
washington
to have to they you know like you got to
put up appearances
you have to make some kind of like video
every six months or so that show like
you care about
like these issues and it has to have
mickey dolan's in it yeah
yeah specifically it has to have that
every video you can't just crank out
booze
and have no consequences you gotta like
look like you're trying
and then we'll lobby
they're talking about legislation that
might make you partially responsible for
duis we need to do something to fix up
your image
get mickey dolan someone called patrick
duffy
i think prohibition was probably one of
the four major mistakes this country has
made
you know three wars in prohibition it
ends up in the rotation at community
colleges or high schools or whatever and
it makes it look like
anhyzer heisha anheuser-busch cares
about the community
they care about alcohol education
blah blah blah blah yes um the host
uh appeared to be drunk and that seemed
to be setting the tone that it was okay
for everybody else to get in that
condition
once again it is 1988 so
all the monkeys were alive
davey jones the only one they could get
is mickey and mickey dolans was the one
who
then was like yeah i'm [ __ ] talking
about drinking
it a typical american male is
um about eight years old driving a big
truck with a gun 88 88
88 88 88
well i think medically when somebody's
had too much to drink we the term we use
is intoxicated
they're inebriated they're out of
control embarrassing
i think the people in drunk are
embarrassing plastered uh
wiped out sloshed please for the last
time you're too drunk
so it'll be okay just letting it go just
let the jerk wreck this car come on
we're gonna have some fun come on
well jay yeah yeah why what do you tell
us about our final tape
i don't remember what it was i'm sure
you do dream bunny
oh god dream bunny it's it's the the
star of the show
oh this is dream bunny promo this is
like
yeah it's not even a real they sent this
out to people to be like you want this
has there been a single cut it's nothing
but dissolves
everything is wrong everything
there's a cut oh okay there was a cut
are some of them wearing pants on their
head
they all are it's like they made it
knowing that in 30 years
someone would make fun of it and that's
the only reason it exists but
what is it and why is it amazing i don't
know any of these i don't know why
why it exists but it's dream bunny it's
uh estelle getty
uh tells a story about a dream bunny and
then we cut to
uh a local theater production of
something still getty's dream bunny the
bunny looks like a sloth
aren't you having a lot of fun with all
the toys and we all know that fun is
good
you're right the the bunny yeah it's
like rastafarian
like it's got the long ears but it looks
like ears yeah they look like dreadlocks
and it's got like a like a
beanie like a beanie on one eye's
drooping a little lower than
the other um it sounds like the local
news anchor doing the voice and you can
learn to dance
sing read and have lots of fun all at
the same time
then when you return to daytimeville see
looking up in the air
and so this is his voice is like the
temp voice that you put in before you
put the real
voiceover actor voice in this is for
promotional use only
maybe it is the temp voice something's
wrong
it's it's one of like a a legion of
children's videos like these are
uncountable
children's videos that have a bunch of
kids wannabe and barney's one wannabe
barney's one guy in a costume and a
bunch of kids and they sing songs
yes and this is the reason why
i'm not an ordinary singing
but let's keep it a secret don't you
blab
it
[Music]
unlike barney this has an incredibly low
budget
yes yes they filmed it on like their
local uh
theater stage and you hear it's like
echo the whole thing has echo to it
i've learned so much how can i remember
it all just think about
songs you find he looks like he got
mangled on a car wreck
i mean like a children's show about a
road killed bunny a road kill yeah
oh my god all the kids are saying their
lines everything has an echo to it's
making a phone call
look out for the clown behind you
oh there's john bonay ramsay
[Laughter]
[Music]
oh you're not going to make it in the
industry
she found out she's just like did not do
a good job
we need a professional mime and jonbenet
ramsay's dead body
so the jonbenet ramsay's dead body won't
move
no the mime won't move you need to
figure out a way to animate
jonbenet's body
well there's the the titular dream bunny
which i think is probably
the most important thing to talk about
because that's that's their wannabe
barney
that's the star attraction
and and dream bunny looks more like
something out of a nightmare
did i hear someone talking about me
because bunny's terrifying
it looks like a sloth
oh god the mouth moves that makes it
worse just like the [ __ ] dog's mouth
from that one
it's like if you are a kid like uh like
pulled off the straight and it's like
which way do bunny ears go are they
gonna be like up or are they
down to your [ __ ] ankles
and you're just like hey man don't worry
about
everything you know or or you
or you ask a kid you know uh are
our bunny's head's symmetrical
[Music]
you would like to be a songwriter
perhaps the same buddy
your nose is just a hole in your head
dream bunny got caught in like a
barbed wire fence trendy okay
we're gonna make the next barney and
it's dream bunny
it's estelle getty in a in a like a like
a little living room
and there's snow outside but we're from
california
so we think snow falls like hot tar
outside the window it's foam it's just
pouring out
i got these white marbles snow weighs
more than lead and it's and it's falling
outside the window and that's still
getting is teaching children
with a little with a little bunny and
they accidentally bought
a stuffed sloth from the australian gift
shop
and they're like yeah bunny slot i don't
know we're californians
all we know about is bottled water and
and fine dining and earthquakes
we don't know anything we're stupid
i guess it's a bunny i've only seen
bunnies on
on the cadbury egg commercial
a sloth is a bunny right we're
californians
we're brain dead um let's make a program
like barney embarrassing i think people
in drunk are embarrassing
um here's yeah i still getting hold this
this stuffed sloth and pretend it's a
bunny
and tell these this this little diverse
group of children
and and one john wayne gates and one
john wayne gacy
that that when you fall asleep you go
into magic land
which is a set of a local community
theater yes
with bubbles and a sloth who looks like
he got hit by a truck
and has ptsd uh walks around and goes
plastered wiped out
sloshed and magic happens
just magic happens we don't need the
details dreamland magic
button period button makes it happen we
don't need to do the work
it's a children's show barney etc button
makes
makes the magic happen boom
[Music]
the clown is the creepiest one because
that guy is committed
he stays like this every once in a while
you see him move because at one point
you were even like is that he
i think that's a mannequin like no he's
moved i thought it was like
he's moved a little bit but not much
there are
several mimes which is odd yeah it's an
odd choice it's so odd it makes me
wonder if this wasn't dreamed up by the
mimes
because you're you're you're a person
and for whatever reason
whatever deranged reason you decide i'm
going to be a mime
and then you go to mime school and you
learn how to be a mine
and then you you graduate my school and
they give you your miming diploma
yeah and then you're sitting around
there with your graduating class and
like
what do we do now and someone just said
children's show
make a dream bunny do they give you an
actual diploma or do they
[Laughter]
[Music]
dream bunny promo clearly
it's a promo they they were trying to
oh promo yeah we could call it a pilot
well i thought it said dream bunny porno
i was totally confused
oh that's your that's your own tapes at
home
do you want to come not now maybe later
we don't bring that to the show that
would be kind of
embarrassing it's a stuffed film
that's a stuff stuff
[Laughter]
i was so glad that landed
here rich
to use produced by build-a-bear
[Laughter]
[Applause]
there's two different types of down in a
video
it's not an original idea but they tried
well that's what the bunny's supposed to
look like yeah
until estelle getty [ __ ] up the
costume
[Laughter]
stop or my mom will make a dream bunny
custom
it's got your mouth drooped sylvester
now is the time of the night that we
choose which is the best of the worst we
have
eight trummy ass tapes
but each of us know which one is the
best out of them
and we're gonna just well let's go with
jay all right
um well i mean you gotta go with second
chance versus magnum force
right oh my goodness we haven't even
watched all of it we didn't even watch
the whole thing and i'm voting at best
of the worst so that says something
uh i i'm a close second though is how to
carve great faces for halloween
very close second i mean you guys
you know me i love halloween and this is
like this will become a halloween staple
for me at this point i'm gonna watch
this every year
it's it's it's like i said it's the
perfect best of the worst tape
i gotta agree with you that they are
they're like oh my god neck they're
they're both best of the worst to me
they're
they're completely even i can't pick one
oh my god so
it's a tie it's a tie for me second
chance versus magnum force
and and how to carve a pumpkin they
overwhelmed your contrary in nature
you just couldn't bring yourself to pick
uh small change
that's amazing that that shows that
tells you how
good these two tapes are the but the
dream
bunny promo no just stop i might echo
you mike with the 50 50 split
yeah i mean second chance versus magnum
force
is amazing but how
how to carve halloween faces is is it
really is everything we want
in a best of the worst wheel black spine
episode
it's it's short it's got it's got no
production value
it's not just just that it's short it's
that it's the perfect length for what it
is
yes it doesn't overstay it's welcome
yeah and it's it's got that that that
personality
in the center of it all it's some some
weird some guy's trying to do
something crazy yeah in his garage right
or his kitchen in this case
and and dream buddy would also be my
tertiary pick oh god
yeah those two or something tim
you know what i'm really upset with you
guys
because you forgot what isn't worth it
and that is worthless it is it ain't
worth it which is amazing
from now on basketball great barry
sanders
he sure could shoot a basketball he
[ __ ]
sank the three better than ray allen
who actually played basketball for the
bucks
a long time ago
but anyway
[Laughter]
i would say the best is still [ __ ]
dude shooting his own [ __ ] self on
the end of his
[ __ ] 43rd birthday or whatever the
[ __ ] it does
it's my birthday yeah it's my fourth
you know it's not my birthday before
of my 44th year and you know what
there might not be a 45th
kabam it's like
the [ __ ] you're watching a man
with still fear in the back of his eyes
yeah still [ __ ] pulling the trigger
on an
upside down gun it was a powerful moment
and there was tension too because like
the angle he had the gun at yeah it
looked like it might have gone just
under the vest
and he he he would have shot right
through the the abs the mortician
section of the
the phone book and he would
he probably would have needed that
20 minutes do you know we're 30 minutes
out
you almost want to think that it's like
a wrestling match between like some
low grade it's like this is a local
wrestling club and it's like
the second chance you [ __ ] do got
done wrong
i was just i was gonna i was against
lethal
he
i think we should finish the rest of
this when we're done shooting
because i would like to i would love to
watch the sober up
before i drive home
we're safe here not a bad idea
it's a christmas miracle more magnum
force
merry christmas everybody christmas
we're gonna watch more of this [ __ ]
weirdo merry christmas
