Rich: Oh! Hi Josh! [Josh notices the shirt, then leaves] No! No, Josh! Wait, wait, wait....it’s ok, we’re gonna--we’re gonna have a perfectly normal episode, we’re gonna watch some movies, and we’re gonna stay on topic
Josh: Ok, we’re gonna watch movies and then we’re gonna talk about the movies?
R: Yes!
JH: The--
R: Yes
JH:--movies we’re gonna watch
R: We’re gonna watch movies and we’re gonna talk about the movies
JH: Alright, ok. What are we gonna watch?
R: Well, today...we’re gonna watch...Steel! Starring Shaq!
[Josh stares at the tape, then takes it and walks out]
R: Josh?..........JOSH!....Josh, we need Shaq!!........I WANT THAT SHAQ!!!
[Josh throws the Steel tape off a bluff into the lake] 
R: [Sighs] Well, Josh, here’s plan B. In my hands I’ve got 3 films, I’ve got, uh...Pocket Ninja…
JH: Uh huh
*Pocket Ninjas*
JH: “Pocket Ninjas, uh, the fiercest fighting force under four feet”
R: Is it little people?
JH: Uh, no, it’s--it’s children
R: Oh
JH: Yeah
R: Oh
JH: “Prepare for a martial arts journey into misadventure when three young martial arts students discover a comic book about the mythical White Dragon.” Comic books!
R: Well, there’s very accurate information in those comic books
JH: Sure! “The kids suddenly find themselves in the middle of a true to life martial arts battle! Turning to their sensei Master Jack for help and guidance, they set out to defeat Cobra Khan and his dangerous gang who are on the loose in the city!”
R: [Flatly] Oh noooooo!
JH: “From the schoolyard to the backyard,  these Pocket Ninjas are the fiercest thing under four feet.” We got the tagline again. And now the question is, do we need to watch the, uh, the Universal, uh, version? [Holds up both tapes] Of Pocket Ninjas? Or--
R: We have--
JH: Or the Trinity version?
R: We have two Pocket Ninjas?
JH: Hmm-mhm 
[Pause]
R: Wait what? [Takes both tapes] What?
JH: Yeah, yeah--
R: So they’re two….
JH: Two
R:...different releases?
JH: Yep
R: Well, I think we definitely have to watch the Trinity release
JH: S--sure
R: Just--just in case, you know--Universal may have, like, tried to clean it up somehow
JH: Ohhh. So you think the Trinity version’s gonna be completely incoherent?
R: I wanna watch the worst possible version of the movie….is what I’m saying
JH: Well, I don’t think you can go wrong

[4:35] JH: What’s our second movie?
R: Uh--uh, I don’t know, something called Cyclone?
*Cyclone*
R: Jeffrey Combs?! 
JH: Jeffrey Combs!
R: Well this got a lot more exciting!
JH: I know!
R: [Reads the front] “An impressive cast, an amazing high-tech motorcycle, and a series of electrifying stunts highlight this futuristic action adventure,” [Flips the case over] so it’s like Knight Rider on a bike is gonna be my guess. Oh, we already have babes on the back cover, I’m sold--[Josh laughs]--this--this movie...wins, there’s--there’s babes, and there’s a man on fire, it looks like he’s coming out of somebody’s trunk…
JH: And Martin Landau
R: “Heather Thomas (“The Fall Guy,” “Zapped”)...”
JH: Zapped
R: We all remember Zapped
JH: Hmm-mhm 
[Plays clip] 
Jay: Zapped is the prequel to Charles In Charge
R: It’s the actual prequel?
J: No, but it’s…
JH: No. Scott Baio and Willie Aames 
J:...Scott Baio and Willie Aames
R: Oh, really? They’re both in it?
JH: Yeah, yeah, yeah
R: I didn’t know, then, then Willie Aames became, like, a Christian?
J: He’s Bibleman
R: And he’s Bibleman now? [Plays clip] Well, anyway, “Heather Thomas stars as Teri Marshall, a brave young woman who becomes responsible for “The Cyclone,” a super motorcycle, after her inventor boyfriend is murdered. Caught between international forces and U.S. government agencies that are vying for the futuristic machine, Terri is thrown into a life-threatening situation as she finds herself in the midst of intrigue, deadly double-crosses…”
JH: Oh!
R: “And high-speed chases”
JH: Yes!
R: “Adding to the excitement of Cyclone is a talented cast that includes Martin Landau,” keeps saying Martin Landau, did you know Martin Landau? [Josh nods] Martin Landau
JH: Is Martin Landau in this?

[7:03] Terri: The words “fuck you” have any special meaning for you?
R: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! I’ll do that!
JK: Deal! Deal! No, you said it! You said it! [Rich laughs]
J: No backsies!

[7:20] JH: Our final film for this evening...is Dangerous Men
*Dangerous Men*
JH: Alright, uhh, apparently Dra--the Drafthouse Fi--Films has deemed this “the holy grail of holy f***ing s**t!”
R: Alamo Drafthouse, who also brought us……
JH: Miami Connection
R: [Looks at the camera] Wow! Wow!
JH: “The supreme masterpiece of (?) action film insanity!” [Silence]
R: Ok!
JH: Cool
R: Ok!
JH: I’m totally in on this
R: I need to see insanity before I’m convinced, you can label anything insane…[Cuts to the guys silently watching the movie]
*90 minutes later*
J: Wait, no, what?! 
[Rich throws a sofa cushion]
JK: No! No! No, don’t throw the--
[Rich throws things around the room while Jay, Josh, and Jack remain seated, Jack laughs] 

[8:20] [At the table]
R: You shake these, right? [Shakes a bottle of 5 Hour Energy]
J: I don’t know--
JH: Do you? I mean--
R: I--
JH: It’s not gonna hurt it if you shake it
R: Fuck it, maybe it’ll be flat, I don’t know [Jay chuckles]
JH: What…
R: (?) 
J: I actually heard that if you shake it too much, it’s toxic, so…
JH: Umpf 
R: Thank God [Drinks it] (?)
J: Ok...
JH: Are those carbonated? I’ve never had those, I don’t take those things…
JK: Was it--what does it taste like?
R: Like burning
JK: Oh
JH: Oh
J: I don’t think it’s supposed to taste like that
[Rich pours it into his cup]
JK: Oh, no, you’re not supposed to--oh…
JH: That seems bad
J: Yeah
JH: Alright
J: Alright
R: Alright, so! We’ve had a long, long night tonight, haven’t we, gentlemen?
JH: Oh boy	J: Yes		
JK: Yeehaw!
R: Our....our first movie...of the night [Grabs the first tape]
J: I see you took the reins right away there
R: Oh, I don’t know why I would’ve done that [Jack laughs] I don’t know why!
JH: No idea why that would happen
J: I like how that’s become a thing now, where it’s like, the first people to, to intro...so they don’t have to explain the movie
JK: Rich, you are a smart, smart man
R: I was--yeah--yes, yes, I knew exactly what I was gonna do [Jay laughs] I was gonna start yakking with the energy drink and then I wasn’t gonna stop until I got to the tape
JH: That’s what happens
R: Which is Pocket Ninjas…

[13:22] [During the bad guys’ training montage]
R: Why am I kind of rooting for them? 

[14:42] J: But we’re getting the first act of a normal movie in the opening credits sequence of this movie
R: Well they--they just explain everything right up front
JH: Yeah
R: Right up front!
JH: Yeah
R: And then the rest of the movie is just...epileptic 


[15:22] [During the main guy’s training montage]
J: Oh man, you could add a fart sound effect

[15:45] J: It’s edited out of order
(...)
JH: It’s like the movie’s like a cup game

[17:11] R: What? Why? Whyyyyyyy? Why? Why? Why!...[Jay laughs]...Why?

[17:30] JK: The White Ranger, uh...Zordon, as we know him...bequeaths powers onto the little ninjas
J: For what reason? Why does he decide these three kids...is there a reason?
JH: They’re probably the best ones in his class, or something like that, or they’re the most pure, who cares [Jay huffs out air]
[Silence]
JH: Not like that! Shut up!! [Jay laughs]
JK: It’s--it’s because--
JH: Pure of heart, asshole!

[18:08] R: This is Rocky IV all over again

[20:50] [Montage #6 starts]
R: I have so much hate [Jay and Josh laugh]
[At the table]
R: This whole movie is somebody’s dream that died
J: Pffft!
R: The dream of being a filmmaker [Jay and Jack laugh]
J: There i--there is one, uh, cinematic shot in the whole movie which is the introduction of Robert Z’Dar, where he comes out of the shadows and the first thing to be illuminated is just that chin...as he walks forward
JH: Yeah
J: I would like to think that was intentional, but it was probably just an accident
JH: It’s just that he’s got so much chin you couldn’t do anything else
J: That’s true
JK: What else is gonna hit the light first? [Jay laughs]
R: They probably spent hours trying to get the chin not to light up first
JH: “Fuck it! Fuck it!! Go!” 
JK: “That’s half of today’s budget gone ‘cause of Z’Dar’s goddamn chin!”
JH: “We only got 3 more hours to make this movie!”
R: [Laughs] Oh my god, it all makes sense!

[27:46] R: But it wasn’t really the White Dragon
JK: Whaaat? [The White Dragon takes off the mask]
JH: Oh guess what--
R: It was...the girl [Everyone pretends to be shocked]
JK: Ohhhh, take--
J: What?
JK: Take that, patriarchy!

[28:43] JH: Look at how that cop is wearing his shirt under his police shirt

[29:10] J: Virtual reality?! Radical!

[30:19] R: I’m out of things to throw!

[30:47] R: At least they never made Pocket Ninjas 2 [Jack takes his phone out to check] OHHHHH FFFFUUUUCK
[Jay laughs]
JH: Pocket Ninjas 2 coming to you--a theater near you July 2017
J: Pffft!
JK: Written by Rich Evans
JH: No [Rich laughs]
J:....Starring Hulk Hogan….He’s gonna use all that sweet, uhh, Gawker lawsuit money to make a Pocket Ninjas sequel
JK: “This is gonna do it, brother”
R: “Gonna put my crew back on track, brother. Just--just make sure there are no black people in the movie, brother” [Jay guffaws]
J: Coming soon to a Redbox near you

[31:36] [Rich picks up the next tape they’re going to talk about] 
R: I think--I think, importantly, though, this is not Pocket Ninjas…

[32:29] J: Are we sure this isn’t a David Prior movie?

[33:48] JH: But it’s a reminder that boobs exist and they’re a place where you can put things
J: Yeah….Yeah, “remember this” is what the movie is telling you [Josh laughs] “You see that cleavage? Remember cleavage”
R: Like I could ever forget!

[34:34] [Guy turns to the motorcycle]
Guy: Now all you need is an oil change
R: AH HA HA HA--[Stops laughing] 

[38:58] R: The man--the man...turns up on a computer screen, tells her to go to another man…
JK: Yes
J: Yes...
R: Who can handle the situation
JH: Yes…
R: And then when the other man gets shot, she has to run away
JK: Yeah
JH: It’s true
J: And then wait for uh, a--a tougher woman to save her
JK: Yeah, an obviously lesbian woman
J: Red (?) short hair, I mean--
JK: So basically a maaan to save her [Jay laughs] [Chuckling] Woooow [Rich laughs]
JH: Oh! Woah!
JK: [To the camera] S....s--send your complaints to contact at Red Letter Media….
J: Let’s put this--let’s put this in context. It’s the early 90s...it’s short hair...it’s a man
JK: It’s definitely a man, is all I’m sayin’ [Josh giggles]
R: Did you see how--did you see how thick that woman was? [Jay and Jack laugh silently] She was built like a bear!
JK: First of all, and! She had a gun and only men have guns, you know what I’m sayin’?
R: She probably doesn’t even shave! [Jay laughs Jack makes a face]
JK: What kind of woman doesn’t sha…

[40:31] J: And then there’s another cop, that should’ve been played by...oh, there’s a--there’s a bug 
JH: Uh--ok
JK: That was like a magic trick 
J: Is that the reincarnation of Cameron Mitchell?
JH: Oh
J: Was that like, “I heard you talking about meeeeee!”
R: It’s karma, he’s now a...shit-eating gnat

[41:07] JH: Not Cameron Mitchell is partner of, uh, uh, lesbian lady
J: Right
JH: And they, um…
JK: Lesbian man [Rich and Jay laugh]
JH: [Yells above Rich’s laugh] Terminology’s changing so much I can’t keep up!....I don’t know who’s what anymore!
[Nobody speaks, Rich looks around a bit]
R: [To the camera] Send your complaints to…! 

[42:03] R: And then they--then she--she takes off on the Cyclone and the bad guys chase her down in Grandma’s station wagon
[In the screening room]
JH: The bad guys have a fucking station wagon? [Jay laughs] A cheap old station wagon?
J: That probably means that it’s gonna blow up
JH: Yeah, that’s--yeah [Rich laughs]
J: A cheap car in a movie--
JH: Yeah
R: Jay, I....I like the way you think!

[45:14] [The main character’s friend is revealed to be one of the bad guys]
R: I saw that comin’ [Pause, Jay laughs]
JK: Oh yeah? You gotta call that shit, man
R: I should have
JK: You should’ve called that shit
R: I should have
JK: ‘Cause then even if you were wrong you can just edit it out--
R: Yeah
JK: And no one would know [Jay laughs] Call all the shit, all the time
J: Yeah
R: Is she gonna pull the--the transformer like out from between her boobs? Is that where it’s gonna be?

[48:27] [The guys are discussing whether a laser would create an explosion]
J: Hold on, I’m gonna tweet at Jeffrey Combs and ask him how strong the laser beams were in Cyclone

[51:00] R: Our next--
JK: Wait, did Jeffrey Combs get back to you
J: He didn’t get back to me
JH: Oh
R: Damn
JH: It’s late on a Saturday, it’s ok, maybe--
J: What time--what is it in L.A. time? Is it--that’s early--
JH: It’s Tuesday over there

[53:17] JH: The fiance strangles...the guy
R: The rapist friend gets killed by the fiance
J: Yeah
R: Which causes the rapist to stop raping and instead stab the fiance…
J: Yes
R: And then after he stabs the fiance he loses all interest in rape, probably because he already poked something [Jay laughs, Jack points to Rich] and then he just walks away

[54:59] [A man shows a woman a police badge that says Policeman Police on it] 

[55:53] J: We need like, when they--when they have like, a, the--the cork boards with all the photos and the string tying everything--that’s this movie
JH: Jay, Jay, we need Scientist Man
[Scientist Man stands in front of a whiteboard with pictures of the characters on it]
[He points to the pictures and nods, then turns to the camera]
SM: Fuck if I know

[56:59] J: No one is this brilliant…..No one is smart enough to come up with something this terrible 

[1:01:15] JK: And, you know, here...on Best of the Worst, we see a lot of rape
R: It’s not our fault

[1:06:33] [A man tries to rape a woman at the beach]
R: She ordered sex on the beach, that’s wasn’t quite what she meant

[1:08:56] J: “Looking For Mina in All the Wrong Places,” that’s the other title for this movie

[1:09:28] [A woman belly dances in front of a couple]
JK: This is not attractive

[1:11:20] R: Black Pepper almost got away...it’s very fortunate, though, that Black Pepper...he ran across a blind woman, which meant he had to stop to try and rape her

[1:15:34] JH: Dangerous Men...it’s--it was almost a Neil Breen level of mindfuck
