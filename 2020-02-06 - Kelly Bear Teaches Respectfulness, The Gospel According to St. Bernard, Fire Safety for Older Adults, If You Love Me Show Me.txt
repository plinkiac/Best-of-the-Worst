I'm glad you asked
let this pre-recorded intro explain
junka is played much like Jenga
each player removes one tape at a time from
any level below the tongue using one
hand only then instead of placing the
removed tapes back on the top a copy of
new key will be put at its place instead
the removed shapes will then be added to
each player's pile the player that
causes the tower to fall will be the
loser the winner will thus be rewarded
by forcing everyone to watch all the
tapes he's pulled from the junka pile

spirit box he didn't get into in sync I
was really bitter about it but Phil

can have all the sex you want with no
consequences this is a destructive law
and is wrecking many of our young
people's lives it's sex baby could we do
more than just talk we get nasty nasty

I see a friend who looks scared or angry

try to help
super I think you have it boys and girls
remember part of the Kelly bear sign and
be especially careful with any heat
source if you use medical oxygen in your
home thanks I'll remember that Barbara
has a smoker I already forgot
Dorothy McPhee has a life-threatening
medical problem what is it I thought to
myself I can't handle this well I didn't
much like the assignment but once I got
here I was surprised to find out that I
was no ordinary Saint Bernard
I looked funny and my voice had changed
so I sounded even funnier
how isn't it great we've got the picnic
tomorrow the prom next week and then
we're out of here I can't believe you
got that scholarship well why does it
have to be 2,000 miles away I know I'm

yes yes yes
cirque de soleil you got nothing on this
it's going up and down falling down
this is the 1998 poster
this is magic how
they came down much faster a bit more
yeah
this is Wisconsin it's winter nine
months of diamonds my nipples are hard
my nipples were hard rap after watching
that animated film of odd come on Jen
what's wrong with loving each other
just get away whines welcome to best of
the worst oh hey I've tortured people
huh black spine random obscene scary I
whirring I won you won my god you beat
Jase you gotta come back now you're the
champ
I know yes I'm very proud of myself it
was the only problem was we were both
really good at it which meant we had
what 22 tapes to go through a lot of
tapes
my brain is mashed potatos scrambled
eggs right now that's okay it's okay
it's a good thing overall because we get
more to choose from we get more to sift
through we find the gold nuggets the
diamonds in the rough we've we've got
four Nuggets here I'm not saying our
first tape is Kelly Bird teaches
respectfulness and friendship skills at
MIT MIT mr. mr. Higgins okay tell us
about this fine tape I think Kelly bear
is pretty much the the second runner-up
good luck bear that like auditioned for
that Care Bear role and didn't yeah it's
hard when others tease us or make fun of us
but it's like fuck you
I'm still gonna teach kids how to well not touch
kids cuz I'm a big ass bear but also
teach them that it's like SAFTA I'm
gonna teach you something that will help
oh my god it's teaching friendship and
respect skills so this big bear that
only if it goes like this its eyes move
so it's like if you're standing over
kids that look like this constantly
moving its head yeah crappy costume is
okay the kids are calling kill a bear
names
well the milk kind of mood but he kept
on poking his chin was very clean too I
mean once it brushed up you could tell
that was brushed up and then brushed
down that's a very brand spanking new
bear right there costume is far nicer
than that production deserved right
maybe they blew it on that bear yeah
well the production value looked like
like a VHS Cameron's in like the local
like like grade school yeah it wasn't a
sadist yeah and then the kids sucked
Sheldon come on out what you'd like to
tell Kelly bear don't pay any attention
to them everybody's different nobody
uses look she's about things line no
mountain is line yeah
don't pay any attention to them
everybody's different nobody's the same
although it's at a talent agency hired
them yeah and I thought maybe it was
just like five kids who wanted to stay
after class an hour like to help fill
this this old lady's shitty videos late
but they were they were really excited
to be there somebody came in and like
who can memorize lyrics quick and wants
to sit around a bear and sing songs and
some kids are like sad embarrassed so uh
rich can you like do some of the songs
from Kelly bear first oh god it's
basically just Old MacDonald had a farm
right mm-hmm and there was also what was
the other one if you know that was your
favorite because there was the hug the
snaps the claps and it kept going your
ego and you can go along oh yes yes
culture is bad to everyone trouble magic
air shows that
we've started doing that by the end
we're like one more verse a number
and the fucking staggering number of verses
is like okay you know what sometimes
like when I went to church when I was a
child there like only verses 2 & 6
yeah that is all that we're gonna sing
out of the 12 please yeah we got places
to be even Jesus but yeah the homily is
long those old ladies get rich quick
scheme yeah and the in the Bernie era
the guy in the guy in the costumes like
her son yeah
oh my god
snap snap snap snap it's too many that's
too many that song doesn't go that way
this isn't a unique song I know how it
goes what's it gonna be
so who made this video was it the old
lady she wasn't an actress she felt like
the author of probably the Kelly bear
book Kelly bear your color doesn't
matter to me I like you just the way you
are and someone said let's make a video
I guess start making some money off she
goes to schools and does presentations
with which we have to talk about one of
her slides yes she has pictures sad the
bureau for at-risk you hero all these
kids seemed on the brink dealing drugs
yeah when you say at-risk use youths you
think like drugs alcohol pregnancy you
know whatever yeah not like smiling her
kids
mmm-hmm I'm alright and it's got in
trouble the teacher a note I mom lost a
sign she's not going to be happy
are you sorry what happened I was just
playing Brian but I was supposed to be
in my seat listening I asked her I saw
face and all my papers
but uh you know the the slides that she
was using essentially from a distance it
looked like green bear boners like those
like massive boners - I mean just but
also one of them was kind of one of them
is like this you know and the other one
was like that yeah just semi BAM right
out there yeah it was sexy over time she
went to the next board and the guys who
sought out the Bears on all fours
spilled his books on the floor in the
school or weren't ready ready for but
stuff were they knocked out of his paws
or did he go oops oopsie
that was fun child education things
yucky or not or it was a baffle nice it
was a Barney ripoff essentially it was
what it was you know I guess like a lot
of sing-alongs kids you know in a room
like in a school room this however
probably was the most effective that
we've ever seen because it was so simple
a lot of times they get drowned out in
in the music or this or that this was
like they had this the simple acronym
and it's like stop you know think about
so much feelings how do you feel what's
your action Stefan's is the only message
in the whole video was stifling
effectively because we remembered what
it was
but also in a world where Bharti exists
it is completely redundant yes yeah well
this lady was just trying to make a buck
Saab this old bag was trying to cash in
on the childhood burns where's your kids
green bear burners recently I think that
that was your motivation what's some of
that Bonnie money she was literally
seeing green with this idea yeah
perfectly fuck you green there's a great
green bear whatever I just that's like a
smoker's voice and I want everybody off
because I'm green with envy agree yeah
stifling whatever feelings whatever
gotta pay for new giant glasses don't
pay for themselves it's like a horrible
monster bye boys and girls
and we're onto an entirely different
person in analysis so you know there's
over there for your back to back huh
yeah mr. mr. McCullen would you please
tell us about st. Bernard
yeah the Gospel according to st. Bernard
all right so this actually like starts
off with a recap of the first episode
that we didn't see but actually that the
opening credits makes it seem like it's
almost like a sitcom
it's like shot that way look in the end
those the headshots with the credits not
stuff
like unintelligible lyrics ah company
rimsey yeah I'm gonna eat you the way
it's explained to us is that everyone
sees our st. Bernard Africa I don't know
its name I don't think they even told us
I'm burning the st. Bernard Bernie
Bernie it's not clever people be like so
uh everyone in the whole world sees the
st. Bernard Bernie as a real Saint
Bernard but our two lead children see
her I guess it's a her it's a lady's way
and that information is never irrelevant
sees it as a yet never it sees her as a
pretty much a person in a st. Bernard
suit who gives kids terrible advice well
if divorce is the only answer then we
better find out what the question was
and tell everybody to never ever ask it
stalks them and it's the pizza no one
was hungry and I get to have the whole
pizza no but we brought you some here so
the episode begins with the classic
sitcom misunderstanding are you sure
divorce is the only answer
it looks like there's no other way I
just don't know if there is any how what
are we going to do I don't know but we
better pretend like we didn't hear
anything okay
the parents are in the kitchen and the
father's voice is completely dumped
I hadn't finished that yet oh I'm sorry
I wasn't paying attention
I'm pouring another you've been upset
ever since you spoke to your sister last
night
what's up completely W we're suing he
has an accent was it it is look yeah
he's like he looks like he drinks crab
juice or something like that Greek army
in Greek he could be could have been
Indian Pakistani yeah like there's it
could be most any races except for white
I wonder what's bothering him he's
probably worried about that test but he
studied hard last night why his dad
dubbed because the microphone was in the
ER but he stopped from any angle than
they've shown him from oh baby they
changed his voice maybe I speak English
I lied you throw out to buy coffee
it's a little the meeting with Watkins
only took 30 minutes so I caught the
next flight home Here I am cuz cuz he
had Irish children yes who looked
nothing like him with it with some
ladies and I was saying I'd love to hear
the original yeah yeah it was very
clearly dubbed over that guy was on
point I mean he matched the lips he just
didn't match the face he was a great
hunter it's a shame they had to cover up
his voice because of racism like
Hercules in New York you said those men
were dangerous dangerous boy
I'm saying so it begins with the classic
misunderstanding the parents are in the
kitchen and they're talking about like
their friends are getting divorced the
kids over here in the other room but
they only hear the second half of the
conversations they think their parents
are getting a divorce
but they try to play it cool and they go
to school and kids pick on them because
their parents are getting a divorce
because obviously they only heard the
second half like you were hanging out at
their house in the early in the morning
round no they never said
my dad are getting a divorce you're such
a jerk oh we're talking st. Bernard sent
by Jesus they're pushing each other on
the swings and the brothers like well I
don't know why they're getting yeah so
go back to Hebrew school Sharon it's
funny this actually is that we thick
with biblical like or at least like a
thought yeah the Christian II kind of
values even it's very very heavy pod
that kind of one ham-fisted only be
funny if it was a pea let's pretend it
was a pig then that
and that's pretty much it though the
parents say they were they're not
getting divorced and they feed the the
stuffed or whatever they'd the dog pizza
well don't get so excited if you don't
want pizza we can order something else
we were really desperate at that point
of the night if we chose that as a
keeper slob but that dog was hiding in
places yeah it's just that shit was
happening on the playground where the
everyone else a normal dog but it's so
they were like that's really weird that
this st. Bernard is standing on its hind
legs before behind this post laughing we
couldn't follow the kids and then like
you know they may land on the dog and
they stay on and it just like this
person in a dog suit just there we saw
these are the st. Bernard mm-hmm except
for the one rule that was broken was the
mother at some point says that st.
Bernard eats ten times the amount of
food it should which means that it
really did eat the amount of it's it's
it's it's a correct body weight correct
body yeah yeah which means it was
pooping that amount of it's correct body
weight so the mother probably would have
taken that st. Bernard to the vet
this dog is shitting so much
and it eats like 40 pounds of food every day
cuz it's a giant costume
it's eating pizza
because these rotten ass kids are serving it food that's not
that dog shouldn't be eating pizza
you don't give dogs dairy
give him some ice cream next, why don't ya
yeah, and some chocolate
Saint Bernard's shitting so much, I keep buying food for it
it's like it's like it's a giant adult size dog costume
with a crooked mouth it's a good
prize I couldn't keep my eyes off of
that it's like this look in here Saint
Bernard is like a droopy lip like a
Stallone lip the mouth kind of falls to
one side
the father's mouth worked perfectly the
real voice of the father should have
been used to dump the dog where you're
going his comeback
bring me some falafel like what if that
was what if Bernie's noise was the
father's voice
the production is a mess
I have watch you at all the time so
that's another weird part yeah we're
Bernie's like I watch you where'd you go
what school your school when were you
there I didn't see you I see everything
you do you think I'm a dog but I'm
secretly I'm gonna walk him when you go
to the bathroom it's okay I'm just a dog
just a dog watching you take a shit
is it the spirit of a like a serial killer
punishment now he's pretending to be an
angel sent by Jesus maybe I'm a space
angel from are you saying that like
everybody sees him as the guy to sue
because he is a guy in a suit because
because the parents are just into some kinky shit
he's like the third partner in their
relationship it likes to dress like a
dog and the parents embarrassed by this
told the children that no no it's a it's
really just a normal dog yeah it's like
a large than a real girl situationally
the whole town just goes with it he was
sent by heaven to be a special friend
sure kids go feed that dog Pizza sleep
mommy and daddy's bedroom see I mean the
dogs not not named Saint Bernard
it's named Bernie right yes so it should
be according you know Gospel according
to a st. Bernard yeah anyone ever mark
I'll fix it
Oh somebody have a marker no sorry
anybody no no no there's nobody here
just us I know we don't have this
production just really set it's really
rinky-dink yeah so so a long fall from
Uncle Buck am i right we should we
should just you just turned the cameras
around every now and then just just so
the audience could see that there is no
crew is a guy in a wheelchair you
shouldn't like you proceed this with
this is film the fight before let's do
your audience and nothing happens just
like oh my god okay a pen actually a
battle over
okay checked out all of the equipment
everything is intact okay we're good to
go
I still want to sign it like some injury thing just to cover my ass
no
to, fuck
no
can i at least ride it once
stop playing with that wheelchair
so many wheelchairs
stop
one day you'll end up in that wheelchair
that would be funny
that would be leigitmately funny
a wheelchair accident
how'd you get that chair, kid
a wheelchair accident
damn
damn
that would be the definition of
Ironman
coincidence
you killed it
i'm with you
i liked it
so, I've been going in order here
I've got our fourth tape
this for so I'm gonna I'm gonna have to
explain one to what our fourth tape was
Oh
fire safety yeah Oh God Oh which we all
know oh my god
you were the man about being cool about
supplier safety it's appropriate because
everybody knows when I was a young man I
almost burned down my grandmother's
house when I was trying to cook my own
french fries for reals Wow twenty-two
you were like eight you thought you
could just pour like a gallon a hot
grease into it like a grease into a pot
and it was working fine I was cooking
the fries but I hadn't lid on but
apparently you should do I'm over hit
the flames no no I took the lid off
check on the fries and a giant soccer
ball came out of the pageant and giant fucking fireball
my first instinct was
his flaming grease in the back wall of
the kitchen no no it was winter dead of
winter my first instinct was to open the
back door and just throw it out into the
snow and I I grabbed the pan and
instantly burned my hand and drop
flaming grease all
the flame wait your first instinct
wasn't to save the fries so uh so you
need some fire safety tips and you are
and you are elderly so I needed a
refresher yes our tape opens there's an
elderly couple there trying to enjoy
their afternoon there in the kitchen the
wife is cooking the steak the husband's
trying to enjoy a fucking cigarette
and then those nagging keeps telling them to
stop what they're doing so she can she
can chastise them hold it a husband and
wife were in the kitchen she's making
dinner he's having a cigarette it's a
scene you might see in millions of homes
across the country every evening so
what's wrong with this picture
well it's also it's a voice is it
disembodied
yes
at first
yeah
it's a disembodied voice
then we keep cutting to her
mm-hmm
and you shouldn't do this or that or this or this
and, just fuck her
yeah
the man just wants to have a cigarette
and then the wife makes him go outside every time
and they're like bitching about is worth the
placement the depth of his ashtray it's
gotta be from our services like I got on
the arm of the couch it's fine he's like
I know today I would do with something
right there's this hole there's this
whole big deal the video about I guess
most elderly people die from smoking
fires they really emphasize putting your
ashtray at a hard stable surface but
also they created paper due to elderly
dying from cigarettes causing fires oh
yeah to go out yes if they know Marlboro
raise
Gray's Marlborough Gray's we're the
cigarette and cigarette that does not
burn the elderly yeah we go out we
promise you got six seconds to smoke oh
there's just 30 different little when it
comes B bums yes they call it was just
this naked lady saying she's hanging
sleeves and she I thought at first
they're like well the bit and the video
is like what's wrong with this picture
you know and then they like kind of
focus in on something and I thought it
was the handle was outwards because you
know little kids are running around you
want handle inward because they can't
grab it video for the butt but I never
produced let they set it up by saying
they sipped ID their cabinet closed so
their grandkids yes so I thought that
the mistake was the the handle
overhanging the stove but it was her
sleeves those sleeves could touch a hot
burner while she's cooking and catch on
fire I have to admit that never occurred
to me I'll just roll them up or wear
short sleeves when I cook electric stove
- it was like it was an open flame think
how flammable is your clothes yeah her
clothes are soaked in formaldehyde
yourself with the smell we're gonna have
a speed up the embalming process from
the outside she marinades every night
but if you can't get out fast or your
path is blocked by heater smoke
emergency numbers oh no what happened to
Mike
well the litter that our only man he
gets the information about putting the
ashtray in a hard surface
so he instantly goes out into the living
room and he knows this so he goes into
the living room and he pushes ashtray on
the couch and so this nagging chest and
a gimmick in what's wrong with this
picture he goes I'm definitely never
gonna do that again but not about
putting it on the soft surface it was
about being inside smoke it was a
different nag yeah it was a different
neg but she was just like what are you
doing wrong he's like oh no it's like
that that this ashtray could fall over
at any second it's that I'm actually
inside it's like it's his own freaking
house yeah what's his voice different
hey voice get out of my house I'll smoke
wherever I want that he was very
relieved once the voice started nagging
his good friend yes oh yes yes the third
part of their throuple yeah why don't
you go bother Barbara over here
oh that's great I really appreciate that
it's a man who's the purple again the
one who currently watered up pieces of
paper in front of her space you know
she's a very dirty apartment she blocked
her own exit door with with her oxygen
tank space heater his space heater and
phone book phone book so can for Melva I
soaked these in form and every night I
love the smell push him up against my
front door a nice swapping spit this
helps oh god she's trying to commit
suicide isn't she happy you're very
fertile now that my dreams
she was peeping the zombies out and this
oxygen take it was one scene where they
actually had a real fire in the house
and anything I wish there's a little bit
more of that when were smattering of
yeah of curtains : cats this actually
does happen not like this could happen
hmm
what's what like like one of those like
um Fire Department like sets where they
they rigged up a house interior and they
draft one of those I used to working I'm
briefly a a fire sprinkler fitter which
is the result of you cooking french
fries for burning those french fries you
gotta go just a job I had the fire
safety be cool about fire safety guy
installed fire sprinkler I got this job
installing fire sprinklers a year before
the economy collapsed and I lost my
child and then I ended up here in
desperation letting Mike make fun of me
for money that's my story
I can't watch movies anymore with fire sprinklers
they always they always put the, the little lighter up to the sprinkler
and then every, every fucking sprinkler in the building goes off
no
it's just the one
it's it's the one
it's actually a physical glass tube in there with fluid in it
oh, it breaks
yeah
it breaks when it gets too hot
so every
individuals frequent even worse idea
from like a just common-sense approach
is when someone pulls the fire alarm Oh
sprinklers whop and things ruin
everything in the building us up now Oh
a massive fire everywhere might set off
the sprinkler alarm they make that but
it's like if you it'd be like I'm
telling us more a paper mill that has
chemicals like it's something a building
that's gonna literally go up in 30
seconds like a firework fact yeah that
would that would have that yeah give her
give her install sprinklers in the
fireworks factory
when are we going to get to the
fireworks factory
that's the Simpsons reference me too
really that's disgusting
get off the show right now you pervert
practice a home fire drill at least
twice a year review your plan with any
guests who visit you overnight the
elderly a friend there they're gonna
pick her up and take her somewhere
they're gone all going somewhere
together towards the end yes I forgot
where I don't know if I mentioned it
we're assuming it's an elderly orgy you
speculated they were there the world's
first swingers yeah first one it's a
whole thing
they're so anxious like the Romans and a
couple thousand years went by and then
these people remember practice makes
perfect
was there anyone else no other
characters yeah there was interlace that
that lady that disembodied voice became
actually she was like like the Florence
Henderson lady like she was she was the
old person who was not too old to wear
shoes ik couldn't understand her and all
that but she was like like well-spoken
trustworthy
trustworthy algorithm
now how long is this video going to be worth it because how many people smoke inside anymore
you know, that's true
yeah
the story and elderly its takes
just like, I'm old enough
I don't give a fuck about vapes
just give 'em a respirator
the old, the elderlies don't care anymore
yeah the people who used cigarettes
they're just gonna get older and older
the ones who aren't gonna switch over to
vaping you're gonna have a massive
influx of people dying elderly people
dying from cigarettes let's get a
skyrocket man that last generation of
cigarette smokers are just gonna keep
getting older they're gonna burn
themselves to death one by one that's
maybe the tobacco company actually put cancer killing drugs in their cigarettes
and so these old fuckers are gonna live forever
but they don't, they'll never tell anybody about it
and they're just like, grandma you're gonna fucking die
it's like, bullshit I'm a hundred, i'm 102

and nothing social capitalism
what's the last one yeah yeah what what
what is our last one Mike wait what what
what am I waiting for what trying to see
if I remember literally I don't know you
do that you do you will you do you
absolutely be the good name of it
anything of know about it oh oh you want
a hint dog costume bear costume mm-hmm
old people and cigarettes
I honestly don't remember the

sex education cartoon right flavor well
of course I love in Barbara then just
give him what he wants
okay so this is if you love me show me
by a family a family of the Americas as
incr Oh international corporation which
is probably a like a front company for a
Christian company because the message of
the tape is do not have premarital
premarital sex basically you mean before
you were married you never had sex
no listen Paul if you don't score pretty
soon the guys are gonna start wondering
about you okay so it's an animated film
that's the big thing to mention and and
of course we'll see it's a cartoon
yeah and look looks like an 80s cartoon
but it's 37 minutes long yes and it's
the The Adventures of this girl and her
boyfriend we which are seniors in high
school yeah they're both they're both 18
there the fact that you call them
adventures it's like adventures what
looks like and I could 9th a Saturday
morning cartoon show from the 80s yeah
he oh
he wants to take her to buttfuck point 
fuckbutt point
fuckbutt point
fuckbutt point
it's the big night
it's the big night
he's taking her up, up to fuckbutt point
"I had a better idea"
"Jenny, come on"
"just relax"
this is one of my last nights together they brought
wine I'm Jim and champagne champagne
really get some and then that I know you
know Jen we've been going together for
six months and you just keep getting
more beautiful everyday food yep yeah by
Christmas
she'll be Miss Universe no burn it opens
with them like and and she hears voices
in her head just give him what he wants
he's just sex-crazed maniac just put out
come on everybody's doing it here's dude
you're never gonna be a man unless you
bring this chick on you know so they
both have like peer pressure going on
and then the story progresses when he
meet a Native American girl yeah who was
the daughter of mother nature and and
father time mm-hmm Oh No here come Romeo
and Juliet number 1 million in one we're
out of here I'll have to spoil their fun
yeah it's almost like Bernie she just
watches everybody but fun point say that
10 times fast it's not buck
so in the process of attempting to fuck, they accidentally turn off their parking brake
and their car is heading off of the cliff of fuckbutt point
oh, no
what point
and then then a windy just winds it back
up
oh yeah to back up on the edge of the
cliff safely nice and safe so that in a
second at the moment yes no exactly nice
and safe and then um our lead lady she
gets out of the car no actually no she
doesn't even do that yet no it comes up
nice and safe and again the exact same
animation oh I'd better get this one
right she's like a Jedi
then she decides to go home and just
leave her boyfriend precariously
dangling off the edge of a cliff on fuckbutt point
he wanted to fuck butt
so she's
actually our lead lady is actually
running down the road and she waves down
a white truck and then there's windy
again you know and apparently we find
out that yes the truck that she is
driving is indeed a time machine
oh my god how'd you get this truck and
get back so quick you didn't even pass
me I guess you could say I inherited
some talents from my folks not again and
the gear shift is set to present but if
she goes forward his future that is the
past convenient straight up
so please please take me back to the
past and just to get him up off the
ridge No so what happens yeah she won't
do it it's like you've swung back but I
will not let him save her boyfriend from
being rapey yeah and she ends up going
back 18 years too much her own mother's
pregnant yeah mm-hmm meet your own
pregnant mom who apparently has been
living in the same place
oh and if she if she stays in the past
too long she'll get sucked back into her
mother's room and since there can't be
two Jenny's here in a few minutes you'll
become one with that baby in there
no now you found it out the only thing
is to go back into your mother's womb
and you get to relive
oh yeah
the 18 years you've just experienced because you were pregnant whore
"it's all my fault"
"I can't blame anybody else this time"
"well, I'm glad you feel that way, for the baby's sake"
"no, i can't be pregnant"
"i just can't"
she didn't even get pregnant
she didn't even do anything
she just had a handsy boyfriend
but, this poor girl
no
she does get pregnant
after, after, they they go back in time and fix the boyfriend's breaks
"okay, the emergency brake works"
"yeah, last week it wasn't working then all of a sudden a few days ago it works again"
then our hero gets sucked back into her mother's womb, relives the next 18 years of her life, goes back to butt-fuck point with her boyfriend
only now, the brakes are fixed
so the boyfriend successfully fucks her
and now she is pregnant
because she wakes up without a memory in the back seat
and she was like what Lily
wait that's the trans take me back in
the past she's like no that's abortion
yes get pregnant I can't have an
abortion but she's that technically
pregnant well we don't know that it's
just Wendy says uh you're pregnant
and she just takes this like ass is
trying to
we think Wendy's trying to scare her
"get rid of it"
"you're not talking about"
"abortion"
this is creepy as fuck
the whole thing is weird
"no, I know what we have to do"
we have to kill Paul
wendy you could just be fucking with her
I mean if I had a time machine, I'd fuck with people all the time
she is pregnant because she had sex once in the back of a car on champagne and that's how that shit happens
you're fucked
so the moral of the story is, if you get pregnant just go back in time
a bunch of times
how is any different from an abortion
that's true that's a very good
point rich depends on how you view
string theory with protection use a
condom and she was like that doesn't
work no I can't be pregnant
I just can't protection yeah well the
protection didn't protect you really
think so of course oh but here don't
forget these gotta be review nuts
oh it's only 99% effect
what does windy know how do windy get
born parents from her parents Father
tanks it was father time and mother nature
I'm pretty sure he fucked some mud
there we go
do you think father time knows exactly
when to pull out yeah but he just
doesn't care he might care about that
but not about his toupee falling off oh
yeah custodian and mother nature is the
liberationists the lunch Li come on
they're called nutritionists so mostly
lunch lady it's like a custodial
engineer a lunch lady is like it's
natural lunch person get welcome bro
is this about the redemption of a
rapists essentially right cuz he's a
good guy in the end sex doesn't buy love
respect does and that's what you
deserved from every guy he turns out
that he loves her in a different timeline
it's a fucked up timeline
so
yeah
it's a different timeline that he
doesn't what we're assuming they had sex
overnight we don't really know because
it's a little vague it's implied and
whether or not it was consensual or not
depending on how champagne was involved
it's implied as much as a secret
Christian film is willing to imply that
so what was was it a dream when she was
on the boat with father time he's just
like one to make wine but it went on
forever yes
real check sexes night - nympho - it
looks like the judge like insects if you
want to have success you gotta wait your
turn
in line
Wendy shows up in the cafeteria with
that awesome Western music to break up
the fight between our protagonist girl and her boyfriend's new slutty girlfriend
oh, yeah
who's ready to put
she's evil because she's willing to have sex
there may be hope for tonight after all
Diana
she heard about the fight you and Jenny
had I think she's ready to do anything
to get you back know what I mean like
they say three's a crowd
"I've missed you, Paul"
she don't give a fuck about her body
remember how we said we weren't ready for you no sex back
when we were still going out Diana well
I think we should try again but she
learned she learns to respect yourself
and respect her body no I'm not going to
windy point and from now on show me some
respect
know what I mean well
ruined it for the toady friend
he's like, hey
oh, yeah
I'm never gonna have sex myself, so why you go have sex with your friend
why don't you bone
that toady friend who is secretly the boyfriend's father
yes
the animation is the same, except for the hair
put a grey streak in my hair
would you go fuck your boyfriend
how many of us have had a friend in high school who really pushed for us to have sex
you know it's just like hey Mac, man
it's like I'm not getting anything but you should really get it brah
look at that over there
you should lay that pipe
yeah
yeah yeah he didn't have to worry about
that
twice anyone looks good next to John
Candy
oh boy alright great tips for a bottle
of Bulleit Bourbon on from his pants

then we're almost done
it's fine
the pain will go away very soon
the pain of those 22 fucking tapes
we watched 22 tapes
22 fucking tapes
4 tapes
this is the best we had
this is the best
this is the best ones
"welcome to the wonderful world of ferrets"
"hi, I'm Kerry Armstrong, and this little guy is a ferret"
"we're so happy you could join us"
"if you'll come along with us, we haves ome other friends we'd like you to meet"
so out of these 22 tapes we watch
tonight which one is the best of the
worst
Tim you know I just for the sheer like
what the hell is going on type stuff
would have to be the abstinence like
mother earth father time I'm a girl in
trees I don't even know what's gonna
love me if you love me show me because
champagne is the only way to get a
person to really show you how they love
you so yeah I would say that if you show
me love me that's the best of the worst
all right Tim is drunk Mac did you not
see the Bourbon so me yeah yeah Oh which
one is the best one which one is no I'm
gonna own this this has to be in my
archive somewhere for sure this I mean I
hate them all you know this was a really
long hard day oh yeah yeah
Oh back-breaking work you know but uh
you know ya know this made my JAMA like
you know yeah like it's the it's it's
the most memorable that's for sure and
like like like any sensible person on
this panel I I would also pick if you
love me show me so Mike how would you
like to derail this episode yeah yeah
how would she like it like this there
was a
both well I'm gonna need to be reminded
of the first three tapes okay okay green
bear yeah you know this is the other
this is the dog in a suit mm-hmm and
this is the only old people fire all
right all right
then the cartoon okay okay I'm I've been
known to be the contrarian of the group
but I am going with the cartoon because
oh my god no because I've never seen
anything like it even even that one
video where it was like it showed like
the penis and the duck
yeah the cartoon was I made how was I
made yes know in terms of like dealing
with like sexuality and this dealt with
even darker topics and reproduction yeah
it dealt with like teen pregnancy and
sexual assault even in a Saturday
morning cartoon style and not an
especially helpful way either no it was
my point in anything I've ever seen
before and we we just don't do that
thing you have an overwhelming urge to
do so many layers we for most tapes
we're like bored and we shut them off
this we're we're transfixed and we are
watching it and and I have not seen a
tape like this in a long time if not
ever that's my pick for best of the
worst if you love me show me well like
they say three's a crowd
like they say three's a crowd
three's a crowd okay yeah yeah
what we asked you to take that glass
before let's sing a song about respect
she chose
with a clock here and a cluck cluck
there here thought there were cultures
bred to everyone trouble my true care
sure is that - everyone shall
sure
sorry
don't you have anything better to do
let you
