this is a [ __ ] nightmare
holy
uh but our first film who killed
captain alex by the walk hollywood
film company yes uh of course this is a
famous
famous b movie which we have never
watched it's true
very excited and a very inspiring story
about
people uh making a action-packed special
effects heavy movie
on less than no budget sure sure
everybody knew wisconsin is famous

wow i know which kind of space cup is
the best movie ever made
our next film is the suckling
he'll always be mommy's little mutant
they'll always be mommy's little mutants
yeah
this is a story about rich evans
[ __ ] you [ __ ] you

yet the next movie is brian
bosworth stone cold
oh that's it and next is the center of
the plinketto board which is dropper's

babes screaming what else what else can
you ask for
uh it's got it all it's got i know it's
gonna have it all
next is ice cream man
and i think haven't we done this on an
episode already definitely not

starring uh clint howard uh famous
star trek alumni and brother of
director ron howard yes the more
handsome are of the howard brothers
women love that then deformed head of
his yes
yes misshapen maybe
misshapen is the kind word for deformed
right is that the more peace eater
i feel like i can't talk about people's
shapes head because mine's very egg
like a normal hat first of all thank you
i appreciate that miss chapin deformed
our offensive words it's
differently shaped differently shaped
but then exactly
that implies that a sense of normalcy
that they are not involved in
so that is also not very shaped head
he has a shaped
mike i
prefer the term alternatively
handsomely alternatively handsome
is that what you've been called rich
alternatively handsome
that's what my mom says about me uh next
is dungeon master oh
that's such a generic title i i thought
we would have watched this by now
i think i confused this with beastmaster
sure uh
and one of the millions of dungeon
movies that we have
on the shelves um you know we'll try to
if we do watch this we'll try to limit
our number of uh critical fail or nat
one
right right right yes
uh next is disintegration
why don't you go ahead and take a look
at this box jack oh no
what do we know we're not going to land
on it so this is a blind pickthis is a blind pin this is we pulled it
off the shelf we looked at the back
okay and we just said let's roll the
dice on this one
and lastly a film that
predates best of the worst a classic
uh movie night movie blood shack this is
the trooper the film also known as the
trooper
and this is the film that inspired the
phrase
shooting the rodeo what a lineup what a
spectacular what a
marvel we have before it's amazing it
truly is uh and it's gonna be a great
time yes
it's going to be a great day let's not
even watch any of these i'm so happy
with just seeing the covers
we don't even need to watch it all right
yeah all right we'll see you later seems
great
where do i leave is there an exit
well jack why don't you drop the first
ball i'd love to
this is a ball
oh there's creepy things back here
oh that's a good one
hello puppy
mike i know i i have nothing to do with
this
yeah i'm gonna make a distraction okay
you put in space jacked
i've wasted 19 minutes of our lives i'm
just gonna go get something
oh rach what are you doing
oh
on your first attempt i landed on space
jacked everybody
and welcome to the star princess
interactive dining menu
please enter your selection
why why the ladies just saw that lady
i'm so happy to be there
well rich this is drop two do your best
jay you've you've put our fate in my
hands i want you to think about that
well what do you what do you want it to
land on and think about this think about
this wisely
okay because what you wanted to land on
whatever i wanted
exactly i definitely want to watch
disintegration
okay that's great that is my pick
it's totally gonna [ __ ] land on
disintegration now
i really want to land on disintegration
man just there go
all right
what is it what is it what is it dungeon
master oh damn
rich we didn't land on disintegration we
didn't land on it
oh oh it failed
uh the dungeon master he
is the overlord of strange beast and
stolen souls
richard mull the sword and the sorcerer
night court
oh they do listen to my card i was going
to say if they don't list night court
that's totally the order i'd put that in
too right he should just
he shouldn't even go by his name he
should just go by bull when he acts in
other things
bull from night court will be his
official credit and jeffrey byron
starring this futuristic thriller about
an evil wizard
who wanders the galaxies in search of a
formidable opponent
to play his brutal and very deadly game
so we're we're mixing sci-fi and fantasy
here
okay okay and we're going to start in uh
contemporary la and we'll spend 50
of the movie in a guy's apartment yeah
either that or wandering around the
woods
well that'll be the first part of the
movie the fantasy part no it'll start
modern la
then the fantasy will be him in the
woods it'll be griffith park
and then he'll go to a post-apocalyptic
world and it'll be the desert see i
think we're going to start the fantasy
land
which will be the forest preserves near
la okay
and then they're going to get in their
spaceship which will be made out of
cardboard
and then that will crash in downtown l.a
okay that's what i think whatever they
can do to keep the budget down
it's thrown in any direction doesn't
matter
oh no i feel bad for him
oh poor guy
goblins
what what what oh
it created a bit of a gravity well
because einstein understood that gravity
and time space
uh intersected with each other that made
perfect sense
i'm sure that's what happened okay mike
it is
all up to you now i'm gonna do my best
save the night you do your best to let
random chance
be random i'm gonna try really hard
the suckling
i'm gonna do it again
if i do it again
very little on the back oh okay one
sentence
after a woman goes to a back alley
abortion clinic
that's how we want any movie to start uh
her aborted fetus attacks her
her boyfriend and everyone else at the
place
that's the place you know we only needed
one sentence on the back of this box
and that was it after a woman goes to a
bachelor abortion clinic her aborted
fetus attacks her her boyfriend and
everyone else at the place
that's like that's like if you're just
lazily describing a movie to your friend
and then it always says he'll always be
mommy's little mutant
uh wow
i have so many emotions right now and
and they're all
horror yeah well let's go watch the
suckling
do we have to
i don't know what to say except the
strangest thing i ever heard
why did they get the wackiest looking
people to be in the doctors because
they're the ones they could afford
because they said we're making a movie
about an aborted fetus monster
and these are the ones that said okay
all right sure
your voice is an anomaly i know i know
there's nothing we can do to fix it or
make it more palatable
or fit into some sort of range no it
does whatever it wants to do
put all the compression on it you want
it he'll still break it it's amazing
i know so people that yeah people that
complain about that like can you lower
rich's audio when he laughs
we do sometimes it doesn't make a
difference
i lower it as low as it goes and it
still is there
i muted it and you could still hear it i
don't know how it works
rich you've been you've been giving cats
nightmares for you
i hate cats it's fine which others you
really
[ __ ] with my cat anyways
welcome to another episode of best of
the worst
right yeah yeah that's still the name of
the show that's what this show is the
green table flincado
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah breath of the
wild yes
legend of zelda we're going on an
adventure today
through the genres mike well jack since
your name is in the title
why don't you tell us all about space
jack i would love to tell you about
space jack
a space jack is the story of a
luxury space ship that gets
taken over by luxury
it's a story of a cardboard box that's
that's full of leaves and feathers
and feathers the story of an unused
spaceship set somewhere in los angeles
the real question is why is there dust
everywhere like they blew through
drywall
because spaceships are made with drywall
they still have to you don't know what
spaceships are made of
it's true no winner i won an award
most creative use of cardboard i'm so
proud of this production
and plastic parts from a junkyard most
unexpected use of feathers
what is that feathers what the [ __ ]
in space jacked jack is trying to
explain
that corbin bernstein uh burnsen
roger he's not a corbin corbin
berenstein bear
jack it's bear stein
hello he he takes over the ship because
it's full of
billionaires and he has a plan to kind
of disable the ship hold the
billionaires hostage to get a bunch of
money
um so uh the intro to the movie
is uh is the opulent billionaire party
in which we see people judge
knees oh yeah yeah that's a weird start
edward tuban from sioux falls idaho has
the knobby sneeze in outer space look
the guy was offering ecstasy pills or
virtual reality porn
the older older people are into the
knee-judging contest
when given the choice the combination of
these things make the
cruise part of this completely
irrelevant
yes both of them you could do in your
shitty studio apartment yeah you don't
need to go on a luxury cruise
oh this wasn't a shitty studio apartment
i mean that's where they shot it sure
oh they did the doodly doo they actually
did it yeah
our sexual fantasy has to be raped by a
caveman
oh my god it is apparently
how embarrassing is how embarrassing
for everyone oh
and she's in the middle like of the
public square yeah
that's the real thing she didn't take
the vr goggles back to her private
quarters or anything right
it's the future they're all just they're
all just uh out and open about this kind
of thing
you didn't fix monica miles up with a vr
fantasy did you
what of it but she's an addict been
through detox and everything
she's the big girl she's addicted to
getting [ __ ] by cavemen
in classic roger corman fashion we get
two sets
well three if you count the hallway i
guess the one hole
the one hallway yeah
you're right that's like a shovel it's
it's
yeah inside the ship well don't forget
the
the captain of the space freighter his
cockpit
i mean that was oh yeah that's quite a
set they literally just shot it in a
junkyard
well it feels like a subpar generic
action movie that they decided later
in in like the pre-production process to
say let's set it in space
because it could be yeah set on a cruise
ship or on a
fancy plane or something they decided
let's make it in space
you're gonna go far in this business
after you
hey thanks for all your help
roger corman had a spaceship set already
for like eight of his other movies yeah
make it on this set and it will cost me
less money
says roger corman can we get corbin
bernson for an afternoon
okay uh he was on star trek the next
generation
roger corbin oh no he probably was
he's in silence of the lambs roger
corman he is
yeah he's in it george romero's in it
getting back to the shitty movie
uh yes this is a very action schlocky
movie without any of the budget for the
fun schlock
well they have the fight scene at the
end and then they have
my favorite sequence in the movie the
explosion and subsequent disaster
sequence which is
that's hilarious
that is the standout like sequence of
the movie
that's where the movie falls apart
literally two
one blast off
all right now you can't pull too hard
why do they feel the silly blue rocks
everyone get on the big set
oh no oh no nothing happened
with every edit it takes like a half a
second before something bad happens yeah
so like are you are you filming
he's putting a bug zapper on his face
why are you doing that
the the poseidon adventure moment
because that's kind of what this reminds
me of
a bunch of rich people on a yacht or
cruise space cruise ship they're going
on a cruise to the moon
and it cost them a million dollars each
to be on it
in the most terrible looking set with
the worst
host the guy with the blue hair yeah and
the microphone and
oh it's just so dirty it looks like the
space cop uh
moon mirror oh yeah it was like terrible
windows
they paid a fortune to go on this junky
ship um
and then corbin bernsen sets off a bomb
or rather he has an android
set off a bomb who does it incorrectly
and it blows up the whole ship
right mostly much to the help of the
budget it blows up
all of the potential cast
not see that coming do you think that
was just unrelated footage of their son
falling
apart
we got some rewrites for you
we had all the cameras rolling now hold
on to your seats everybody it's
getting nothing but boring yeah
hey we got excitement
it's an action movie where our action
heroes don't have anything actually need
to do
like see virtual reality like sex
addiction lady
that should have came into play later
where she tricked corbin bernstein
into having virtual reality sex
if a character has a strength or a quirk
you use they use it later in the film to
the advantage of the story
yes instead of the end a guy just
punches corbin bernsen
that's true
and then lets toxic gas into the room
so corbin brunson freezes freezes and
then
he left the set so they still needed
shots where his character would be in
the background so they just put a crew
member
under his sheet because carmen runs to
the left he's [ __ ] favorite part
one of the neat aspects of this being as
low budget as
it is is they have like anti-gravity
moments
you know they have moments where the
characters are in zero g and like
floating around and they're
shot shockingly well yeah yeah i think
we figured out how they did it
how they like hung them from the ceiling
and they just had the whole set kind of
sideways or whatever but it's not bad
it works really well yeah yeah and far
cheaper than apollo 13.
they skimped on the budget for the
helmets that they wear when they're in
space
i like how it just goes on the shoulders
there's no like sealant
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's
not it's a helmet
[ __ ] it go go go watch him put it on
with nothing uh underneath it yep
it looks like one of those like
old-timey diving helmets yeah
so that zero g scene there was a an
incredible
zero g scene where they had to climb the
outside of the spaceship
that given just like 10 more dollars
could have been
super exciting and intense but um
closest we get to any kind of tension in
this movie
i can't grab anything for some reason
fingers stopped working oh you have to
close your hand
i've never been to space before
a special note needs to be paid to
corbin bernson's performance
he well yeah this was like i'm gonna do
whatever i'm here for a day and a half
i'm just gonna have fun with it
is this some sort of [ __ ] android
revenge you think you're human now
you're not inching along
a lot of people watching this might not
realize that
this man was one of the biggest stars
on one of the biggest network shows 30
years ago
it's not like it's not like this is just
a nobody
this is somebody who can theoretically
act there's a whole graveyard
filled with movies of actors that have
passed their prime
that do [ __ ] like this it's not
surprising but but
long enough for him to actually forget
how to act
no he just didn't care no he knows how
to act he just doesn't give a [ __ ]
watching this what i'm saying is
watching this you would not realize that
this is a man
who can in fact act right
he's he's entertaining himself to the
detriment of the movie
i would say that he's chewing the
scenery but i know he doesn't like the
taste of cardboard
trying styrofoam
better cardboard is more hard consonants
styrofoam and hot glue yeah yeah
cardboard cardboard's funnier
punches more styrofoam i would say legos
he doesn't like the taste of legos
because the set made of
well legos of bad though the the ship
that they get onto at the very end of
this
is somehow even worse looking than our
main spaceship set
it looks like backstage at a high school
theater production yeah there's just
shitless
stuff what do we got left over it just
looks like right over there
yeah yeah it looks like the corner of
our studio brooms and
some wall some flats your goddamn
android
i programmed you what
for some reason our main villain is now
wacky
yeah they made the decision to make him
uh
well like a home alone villain yeah
and this dreadfully serious uh science
fiction film
i would like to make a special note of
the weird-ass soundtrack
the real star of the film not corbin
bernsen
it's the birdman score
it evolves over the it starts with
literally
one string on a violin just
then you get the congo drum
then you get a counter drop the congo
drum why not and then it turns into
literal arty farty [ __ ] birdman
drum solo only soundtrack
improvisational jazz yeah
there's a trumpet then there's a guy
cleaning the reed for the uh
like tuning something corman was like
that was perfect he said oh i wasn't
even playing anything i was just
uh tuning up my instrument oh that's
great then i don't have to pay you
because it's already in the film
we're moving on we have to score
carnosaur three this afternoon
that is ten minutes of your service
here is your coupon to subway i bet you
this is some labs in connosaur3
it's not necessarily space it might be
science labs
is so strong i think i think they were
going for like
unhinged bad guy but but the score
the score throws what is what threw it
off we spent less time
rolling around in a spray painted office
chair
more time trying to get bank account
numbers he might have been more
successful
i'm glad we never saw die hard starring
corbin burns would have just rolled his
office chair right out the window
john mcclane never even has to reach for
the gun john mcclane had just taken his
shoes off and he just hears
somebody oh wow what a weird christmas
party this is honey
anyway back to the movie
oh look space checked ain't got nothing
on the dungeon master
dungeon master why don't you tell us all
about it rich the
the dungeon master is aka rage war
aka rage war uh there's a computer nerd
who has all of the technology like he
has he has magical
uh glasses he predicted tons of things
that are now common technologies
google glass his glasses are basically
google glass yeah he's got a fitbit
he's got a he's got a fitbit and he he
can use this technology to manipulate
stop lights yes which is you know not
accurate today but still oh also he
invented siri
how was my time three minutes over
yesterday
so he goes home to his girlfriend and
froze his door
and then she turns him down because he's
a computer nerd
even though even though all this hot
tech he's sitting on
we know this man's gonna be a
multi-billionaire within a decade
even beyond that rich he has a stable
job and looks to be in
he's a healthy man with a stable job and
they seem to have a good relationship
who cares if he's a tech nerd if that's
his job she's jealous of the computer
yes yes that's important to note
it's not because he's a computer nerd
it's she's jealous it's true that's true
she's jealous of the computer and then
they're kidnapped by satan
then that happens it's important to
phrase it that way because it just
happens
there's no setup for it it opens with a
fantasy scene
and then he has another fantasy sequence
and then immediately after he has the
other dream
satan teleports him to hell yes
i don't believe this
so he had a dream about a fantasy or a
fantasy world
and then he got sucked into his computer
to a fantasy world
wait so this just happens i guess yeah
no hinting
there's no likes like you don't start
the movie on like
like the creepy hand scrying i need to
find my next job
oh that was a great yeah
this computer nerd looks to be a worthy
adversary
yeah satan just shows up
that's bold from nightcore oh it's man
it's [ __ ]
yeah it's
but he has selected what's his name did
computer just
calm computer nerd yeah he selects
computer nerd as
his his next opponent because computer
nerd
has this wonderful new magic yeah
because satan
sees that the computer google glasses
and everything
as some form of magic yes it's actually
kind of an
interesting little setup here where he's
like i have witnessed you have
mastery over this new magic technology
so you are worthy opponent like that's
that's interesting i'm okay with that
well that's that's what they have is an
interesting concept
they don't flesh it out into an
interesting story yes
yeah well the the the
the bad part too is like this is not an
interesting concept
right no um this is an interesting
concept
but it also has the ability like the
it has the props and the monsters
and like this is just no
like so the sets are so bad um
but this like some of the stuff in here
is neat well i think it's
the zombies look great yeah well like we
talked about with space jacks
like the theory that oh they had
existing sets so they just shot a movie
on it yeah uh dungeon master it's
important to point out is directed by
like six or seven different people
yeah it's a bunch it's a series of
little vignettes challenges
satan gives them the setup is satan says
that
computer nerd has to go through seven
different
challenges and every every challenge is
a little
little mini movie directed by somebody
else yeah and it feels like because this
is produced by charles band
and a lot of the directors or people
that he's worked with before on movies
like
you know ghoulies and puppet master and
all this [ __ ] and it feels like
a lot of things that they already had
like laying around
we see at one point uh john carl beakler
our ip directed one of the segments
and he just flat out reuses his little
google puppet from
he's like death stalkers demon goblin
yeah it's the exact same puppet from
death stalker
uh one shows up well yeah
that's what it feels like though where
it's like hey we have all these things
we have access to the band
wasp
new director so
what's the challenge here just to listen
to the music
so one of the challenges is like facing
the rock and
roll demon guys there's nothing to do
with fantasy or anything
but we know the bandwagon they did a
music video for ghoulies too
so let's throw them in here
this sucks no no this is something
special
yes yeah this is great the girl is
always in in peril in every
scenario for some reason because i guess
if he doesn't complete the challenges
they go to hell right
that's the threat he gets both of their
souls yeah uh
the guy who is a computer nerd and he
should have been a game programmer
oh yeah yeah i'm really hard on
programming this fantasy game
where you you know you go through these
challenges and you fight these monsters
and then satan says he makes a deal with
satan
for our escape you can challenge all
these mortals via these games and all
over the world people will be playing
and
and i'll keep satan busy for millennia
yes right
or like i have a challenge for you i've
made a game you have to play in my game
something some fun clever twist
so they punch each other
just like this one that is the major
that is like the first major problem
with this
there is nothing clever about any of the
challenges
yeah he doesn't have to solve puzzles
and it's always shoot the laser
he he needs to be with somebody he can
talk to
yeah it's weird that he's just silent
through the whole thing yes
give him a sidekick and he can say
things like well what do we need to do
in this
challenge i don't know dan then
then you know they could formulate a
plan execute the plan
maybe have to improvise along the way
yeah yeah
you know like what would happen in a
movie maybe maybe
maybe the the girlfriend isn't kidnapped
maybe she's with him mm-hmm
and she learns about computers can he
has to use it on his arm
and he learns that she has some useful
skills as well
yeah sometimes you can't always rely on
your computer
get it lying good old-fashioned human
intuition that's right
it's like you've seen a movie
in the fantasy land his computer cal is
an armband his computer armbands right
and it serves the same purpose
every single time he uses it which oh it
shoots a laser well the problem is
he ends up in scenarios
where computer technology doesn't exist
so there's nothing for the computer to
interact with
like during that car chase the closest
thing i could think of well there's the
real life scenario
which he does use to disable the police
locks on the the car door remember that
was lik
a non-laser i'm trying to think of
non-laser applications
of this armband but everything else is
just like like
ghouls and goblins kind of stuff sword
and sorcery where
a computer is not applicable whatsoever
yes
not einstein
or leftovers from madame tussauds that
closed
yeah looks like every criminal in the
world is here
and einstein
for his crimes against god
he's just waiting for it take that jack
the ripper
oh my god the mummy [ __ ] you mummy the
mummy the wolfman and einstein
history's greatest monsters
this guy he is he's fit
he's in shape he jogs he's a handsomish
leading actor man and he's already
dating the girl and or getting married
sure she's
not quite sure about marriage because
she's a little jealous of computer but
what you do is you have the the
cheerleader type
who is kind of like oh that's the
neighbor kid
you know he's he's kind of nerdy oh well
i really like
computers yeah but but she still has a
little soft spot for him oh you're kind
of cute you know you know you know where
i'm going with yeah
and um someday i'll get a you know he's
not
he's not he's not hideously ugly like
most nerds
what i call movie glass is ugly right
he's
he's he might be kind of normal but he's
got the glasses with the tape in the
middle and he doesn't quite know what to
do around the girls and he's into
computers
and then she ends up in this in the in
the in the hellscape
with satan and she's like it's you
you're here
you're the hero right right i'll show
you
and then throughout the course of the
movie eventually he'll lose his glasses
he might gain some courage and some
strength and then he'll prove to her
that he is indeed
a hero on the inside and out
punching satan sure well no we don't do
that he outsmarts
sure you do something more yeah you
don't but but that's like the kind of
the typical 80s like
set up right you don't have like
handsome football jock man
as a computer nerd also
and that's that's i will say this movie
we're talking about everything that gets
wrong
the fact that it gets all these things
wrong and it is so blunt and stupid
is what makes it entertaining in its own
right it does it has a bit of a charm to
it premise alone is so great
they really fumbled it but that's a lot
to me that's the charm though
the fact that they they just went with
the dumbest most simplistic thing
for every possible idea makes it fun
absolutely i shall destroy you
i reject your reality and i substitute
my own
hey that's something i know that sounds
familiar what is that from
i reject your reality and substitute my
own we we do know that
there's at least two fans of this movie
one being jj abrams
because he cast the lead actor in a very
minor role in star trek oh nine
how the hell did that kid beat your test
and the other being adam savage
of mythbusters that's right yes the
famous quote
it's a famous quote to somebody and i
guess it is to adam savage
it's it's a line that he said on
mythbusters that
became very very popular but apparently
it originated right here in the dungeon
masters
well i see i didn't even know the adam
savage connection i just heard the line
in the movie i was like i know that from
somewhere yeah it's it's out there in
the pop culture
it'd be like if if we like in uh in
space jack if someone said yolo
you know like we're just like that's
weird
yeah i know that yeah that's so high
that shouldn't be a thing yet
why are they saying that here
i offer you freedom and well sufficient
to create your own
empire he became donald trump
this is the trump backstory
i reject your reality and substitute
oh my god
oh my god there's no way i can fight
this man he's too large
that's something it can do
thanks kel hey
what made a little rod for mcgregor
that would have been really cool for
like a challenge earlier on i guess
we're stuck here in hell
oh you're right i knew that was what was
gonna happen back to the apartment
and even though the devil is now dead
and no longer has the ability to
teleport them back home
they teleport back home and more
importantly
the girlfriend realized the importance
of the computer and said yes
to marrying the hero why didn't you tell
me it could shoot lasers
i would have married you years ago well
considering that
the computer was the one that drew the
attention of satan
i think that would have been reason
enough for her to leave him
right like she became a she became like
a born-again christian after that
i'm out of here she became amish after
that
i knew california was going to be weird
i'm moving back to jersey to star in the
suckling i'm gonna yeah
that sounded like a segway if i'd ever
heard one no
please stand by for a message from our
sponsors
from loot crate
another aborted idea
i reject your reality and substitute my
own
so trigger warning yeah
trigger trigger warning i don't all of
the triggers
all of the triggers like it's uh
about an aborted fetus that turns into a
mutant and kills people
so there's going to be some abortion
talks a little bit of rape
a little bit of rape talk yeah there's
all the badness in this
red letter media content warning all of
it
we're very sorry but this is the movie
we watched this is a red letter media
first
we've covered a lot of [ __ ] up things
you want to give them a time code if
if you're easily oh just shut the video
off it's utter
it's sleaze it's it's completely it's
intentionally tasteless
it's what they were going for well like
an abortion let's just get right into it
i will say though it is weird because
once you get past the initial setup
the rest of the movie is a below average
monster movie
but that initial setup is quite a doozy
oh boy
what the [ __ ] what what
what is this the brothel
it just looks like a hospital oh i would
hate that
it's a hospital
heck with it let's just watch the
trooper
but i i i i i'm i'm i was the one that
read the back of this box
and i was shocked by the simplicity on
the vhs the whiteness of it yeah we
happen to have a blu-ray
um the the vhs was one sentence the
blu-ray is like five paragraphs
there's a lot on the blue right here
although this is vinegar syndrome so the
second one is probably about the
transfer or something
yeah it is it is yeah um i don't know if
i should read this
or would it help if you read it um
as a quick synopsis oh sure because that
might help
okay get this over with as quickly as we
can
after being tricked oh that's right
that's a part of it too after being
tricked into having an abortion he's
like that's not yeah the
[ __ ] man at big mama's underground
abortion clinic
slash brothel it's a one-stop shop
it's your first time kid
yes yes it is at a brothel or an
abortion clinic
hey princess does he do all your talking
for you you're just too good to speak to
me
i'm sorry janine's talking to you i'm
sorry annie putts
take it from me it's no big deal picking
up and dropping off
a young woman's extracted fetus is
flushed into the sewer system
wherein it's exposed to toxic waste and
begins to mutate into an ever-growing
and increasingly bloodthirsty monster
the girls
john's and other assorted weirdos find
themselves trapped inside the brothel
where they're forced to face off against
the agitated
uh prenatal creature as well as each
other in a high-stakes quest to stay
alive
or at least in one piece shot entirely
in flushing new york
well the the setup is weird because yeah
yeah take it away jay well okay so they
go
she goes the the main character who may
or may not even have a name i don't even
know
um she goes there with her jock
boyfriend to the abortion clinic but
they go there and it turns out she goes
into the room they tell the boyfriend to
wait out in the waiting room yeah like
cd yeah yeah they're like only only you
know you have to stay out here only
she's
she thinks she's just going to talk to
them she says it's really weird yeah she
says i don't want an abortion i want to
keep it but i'm here just to
to please appease my boyfriend she wants
to talk about options with the ladies
she brings up
maybe having the baby and giving it up
for adoption and she's trying to please
the boyfriend he's forcing her to go
here yeah but he has an ulterior motive
yeah we
cut to the basement where he is paying
extra to make sure that they
give her a super abortion um
child i don't need your money i own this
big house and i'm living good
i just like
i'm in it for the passion there's no
eyes no ears no
fingers it ain't human i think she wants
to lie about having it
and this lady says tough titty toenails
i'm giving you an abortion so
she's getting an abortion against her
will
what a weird business model big mama
turns out she's not just in this for the
money
she's not just performing a service to
people she just apparently likes giving
abortions and will give them against
your will
yes yes
she's a true villain that is not treated
like a villain
no after that after that initial setup
she's just treated as a victim like
everybody else right
oh we should feel bad that big mom is in
trouble same with the boyfriend
yeah who is giving his girlfriend
an unwanted abortion yeah there's no no
sort of
moral consequences to any of this and
then boyfriend almost kind of takes on
the protagonist role after this
yeah phil what's going on
look everything's going to be all right
relax honey
you have a good boyfriend what um okay
so tonal swaps
this movie shows a bloody little aborted
fetus
yes before that
there is a comedy scene in which a man
has a dildo stuck up his ass
and to show that he enjoys it the beanie
that he is currently wearing on his head
the propeller beating yeah spins
yeah this is what happens when sam remy
meets john waters
i i don't know you guys mentioned the
john waters thing but i don't feel like
most of this movie has a sense of humor
about itself
i think it thinks it has a sense of
humor i don't know it's very it's very
weird because because
going back to the yeah we follow up the
the the propeller beanie scene with the
abortion scene
which is not played as funny it's not
like they're going for like
troma shock value humor or anything but
then we cut two
they take the the boarded fetus and they
flush it down the toilet but
that's not presented as com no no it's
disgusting
i don't know if it's supposed to be
funny because i mean the idea is so
absurd
no it's presented so matter-of-factly
the fishing line is funny
that's not where poop goes not in a
storm drain it's a different system
but that's okay for for an establishment
that that aborts fetuses apparently
late-term
fetuses flushing them down the toilet
isn't the best way
to dispose of the baby because it's
going to clog up the pipes
i mean it's just
it's childish look they've been at this
for a while they know what they're doing
they're the experts not you mike big
mama knows what she's doing
they got a really good toilet system but
it's gross
it's it's literally like stomach
churning grows yeah sure
because it kind of really looks until it
becomes
deformed by the toxic waste it really
looks like it like a dead
baby well the [ __ ] up thing is once it
goes down into the sewer
even before the toxic waste falls on it
it's moving around
yeah it's still alive yeah oh
look oh my god
it's crying it's alive somehow and it's
like little chest is breathing
yeah and it's making noise cut too so
like that's like a
serious disturbing imagery cut to
a comedy scene in which big mama
is un bending the coat hanger
that she used for the abortion with the
goops she's pulling flesh off of it
and then she uses it to hang her coat on
that's like the most like edge lordy
joke in the movie
yes that's uh edgelord very like ooh
am i pushing your buttons but it's kind
of just that part
yeah but but one detail i'm sure
you'll show a clip of it but she doesn't
even properly fully
clean off the hanger i think that's
supposed to be funny
yeah that's that's kind of like where
it's just taking it way too far where
it's like
is this supposed to be funny is this
supposed to shock you is that she's so
sloppy
is that the point is that she just
doesn't care she's been doing it so much
i know the
it's supposed to shock you that she's
reusing the coat hanger
like that's not something you would see
in a mainstream movie
we're pushing the envelope
that is the cutest most disgusting thing
at the same time
i don't know how to feel about this it's
weird
and the coat hanger yeah like see this
is like
this is tasteless but in a arty way um
the coat hanger yeah coat hanger gag and
the dildo gag
are like that's a different movie and
then the rest of the movie is a standard
monster movie
yes
where was it hiding below a frame
with with confusing plot developments
some weird logic with with the house not
being able to get out of it
yeah why can't they just go outside yeah
it's like they knew like well we have
this location
the whole movie's going to take place
here why why don't they just leave
oh the door won't open i'm just i'm just
picturing like
the guy who's holding like the boom mic
he just says
well why doesn't everyone just leave the
house and then there's just like this
awkward silence where everyone just like
looks at each other the guy opens up the
script and just
hold on well they established one window
has i'm assuming it's supposed to be
like placenta or something
and it's covering up the whole window so
they can't get out through the window
they don't establish that on the door
but when they do get out of the door
eventually we discover
a maze of of
fabric joanne fabrics just exploded
we sweat it down
he's in the placenta zone
which is made up of ropes i mean
especially if you're making a movie like
this where
clearly part of the intention is to
shock and gross you out
and then they gave up on that after the
first 10 minutes but yeah if you're
you're
having your character crawl through this
like sinewy
gooey like womb make it gross
and and and to counterbalance that or to
counter that
the monster looks great
i think what i liked even more than the
final monster was the transformation
sequences because they keep cutting back
to the sewer the monster
is is of course an aborted fetus that
gets flushed on the toilet
somehow ends up there's toxic waste in
the backyard
that drips down into the storm drain it
gets dripped on by the toxic waste but
then we cut we don't know why the toxic
waste is back there
and if it's been back there for a while
how has this never happened before
look they're an abortion clinic slash
brothel
they're probably also tripling as a
toxic waste dump
an unauthorized toxic waste dump on the
side big mama is an entrepreneur
sure you want to dump your toxic waste
in the bank yeah i'd fight
maybe maybe just a day before jay
that toxic waste barrel was 10 feet away
and somebody pulled in their nasty
pickup truck to come get an abortion and
they banged it with their car
rolled it right next to them we should
have seen that that would have been a
good scene
a client left was so happy with their bj
that they were like they weren't painted
oh what did i hit oh well
i'm so happy cause i had a bj right
speaking of troma that's the setup in
the toxic avenger
it's it's these two guys driving a truck
filled with toxic waste barrels in the
back
the main guy who becomes a toxic avenger
he works at this health clinic
and they decide to stop to like do
cocaine
and they happen to do it right in front
of the uh the the place where he works
so he set it all up and there's a toxic
waste so when he falls out the window he
lands in the toxic waste
it's not just toxic waste that's there
for no reason yeah
a backstory motivation for why the toxic
waste barrel was dripping
into the storm drain onto the aborted
fetus is important
but i'm still trying to get to that
transformation we have
four or five cutbacks to the
transformation and and he's getting
bigger and his eyes are
opening up little tentacles are coming
out of his arm and it's crazy
an umbilical cord shoots out of his
stomach right yeah yeah that's his
weapon his
umbilical it's umbilical
oh they attempted to do a reverse
photography thing but it didn't quite
work
oh whoa what that happened
somehow pulled her head down so hard
that it decapitated her
our what should be our protagonist which
kind of turns out to be the case at the
end
is our main girl
who is i think a college student they
keep calling them college boy they seem
like high school kids the main girl
who is in the movie so little we don't
know her name
her occupation her backstory where she's
from
what she hopes for in life where she was
for half the movie
well the boyfriend has i think he's
wearing like a letterman jacket so we're
going to assume high school or college
obviously she's his boy girlfriend so
blah blah blah
but she's the abortion victim she's the
the source that's a weird way to put it
yes she is an abortion she is
she got an abortion against her will yes
this is not us making a judgment on
abortions in general
in this case
disclaimer
typically an abortion victim would be a
baby
but in this case she is an abortion
victim in a different sense
i guess technically you're correct
but yeah
we're just being we're just being honest
here this is the movie
this is the movie that we saw and we're
discussing it
unfortunately um but yeah
she disappears throughout the whole
movie and that is your starting point
because you
uh likened her to barbara from night of
living dead
i got so afraid i ran i
ran
how could you do this yes who is is
basically comatose catatonic from most
of the movies but they established that
and we know that
here she's just not in scenes and i was
like where is she
right what courage
where's the the main girl the one who
had the abortion
yes that's a great question she's at
school
oh you mean while they're filming yeah
i'm just thinking like
she's the one that had the abortion you
think they would be building up some
sort of like she has a connection
with it or something yeah i don't think
they're gonna say that this is the best
of the worst
be careful also like they've completely
just forgotten about her in the movie
yeah she's just gone
not anywhere where's she at in this
house
when the monster finally comes face to
face with the mother
it it doesn't know what to do or has
sympathy it's like alien resurrection
where it kind of feels sad and then
ripley
knows the best thing to do is to kill it
yeah because she can't allow it to get
to earth
right and that could kind of be the
ending with the girl is the whole
point of the movie she didn't want to
get an abortion now she has to
kill it to save other people because
it's going to keep getting bigger and
bigger
it turned into a marionette
why didn't they use the other puppets i
don't know
maybe they lost it they lost the prop
i think like the real point of all of
this is that
there was no there was no urgency to any
of the characters and there was no
connection
to the chara from the characters to the
monster where it's like
really that was the story is like the
main girl's
relationship with the monster because at
the end of the day most horror movies
are monster as metaphor right godzilla
nuclear power both
good and destructive discuss godzilla
and so here you have an opportunity to
discuss like the greater
fear of motherhood the fear of
motherhood the responsibilities the
danger of having a pregnancy too early
the danger of
bodily harm blah blah like there is a
lot of danger of a back alley abortion
exactly like there is meat on
this particular bone and i really hated
saying that i'm so sorry
i know exactly what footage i'm going to
overplay or you saying
oh no
so are they going to attempt to rape her
no the monster but come out
the fetus monsters i
yeah and then ends up in an insane
asylum getting raped
yeah it's like well that's not what we
want to even though the rapists get
their comeuppance
no pun intended i got it it's just not
going to laugh at that
overcome
it was a pun but she still
she still is is in a psych ward and
getting raped and it's
not pleasant
no uh uh yeah yeah just uh
that's the perfect summary of the film
by the way yeah i
i think we've dissected this
as much as we could in fact you could
say we pulled out as much as we could
from this film
let's let's kill this discussion early
let's end this you guys like i don't
know if this movie will work do we have
a plan b
we got we got jokes all night
oh i feel terrible
all these guys want to do these days is
shoot their load in your face
well everybody it's that time a night
when we get to pick
our best of the worst um i'm going to
start
from my left jay
oh your best of the worst uh i i think
most enjoyable
is dungeon master the other two
are interesting in their own right the
suckling is something else
that's that's something special but we
should point out that a lot of it is
kind of boring
there's the initial setup and then
there's the ending which is [ __ ] up
the middle section where it's just a
monster movie is kind of dull
uh i think i'm gonna echo your
sentiments uh i think dungeon master is
the best of the worst
i really wanted to love space jacked
because i love
a terrible flimsy set
sci-fi schlock movie but
it didn't have much more than the flimsy
sets though yeah
it didn't quite live up to that true
like level of a
really funny b movie um this this is
just
batshit bonkers crazy all these things
are happening there's so much stuff
going on
um and the suckling
gross decent cinematography
there were some attempts at interesting
lighting through out of it throughout it
there's the the fan the light going
through the fan
okay okay camera movement yeah
well then we're all echoing each other
so far because i am going with
dungeon master and space jack just dull
it's just dull yeah what about the lady
who had a fantasy about getting raped by
a cave
that looked consensual to me i'm just
gonna put that out you know what mike
you sold me i'm making space jack
my pick for best of the worst because
there was a woman who fantasized about
being forcibly taken by a caveman
that was the winning argument mike i
knew that i knew that would push you
over the edge rich
uh jack before i choose dungeon master
as my best of the worst i would like to
give a special commendation
to space jacked as it was
in my opinion the perfect first movie
on a three movie month by which you mean
it was the most boring
but i mean technically it was the second
movie but we don't talk about ice cream
man
that was a perfect warm-up movie the
dungeon master was clearly super fun
though
uh as uh as someone who has been playing
a lot of dungeons and dragons throughout
quarantine
i am a little upset that there weren't
more dungeons or dragons
so it did have a wolf man
never mind it's perfect yeah yeah you're
right well dare i suggest
i would i would probably say none of us
want to destroy any of these
the suckling is despicable but it is
just a movie it's unique and it's unique
and yeah yeah it is a nice looking
blu-ray and it is something
that is yeah shout out to vinegar
syndrome yeah they always do top-notch
work with
even something like the suckling is
something that would never
ever ever ever be made
today under any circumstances
uh so it is a nice look back at
1983 89 89
89 99 at kind of what
what sickos in new york were doing in
1989.
it's borderline for me i would be okay
with
passively destroying space jacks where
we destroy it but we do like the least
amount of effort possible to destroy
okay
what about instead of instead of
destroying it we just kind of leave it
somewhere and forget about it
oh where where is everybody oh hello
hello somebody told me to come out this
way down this hallway hello hello hello
space jack what ah there you are space
jack
what you know you did a real good job as
a movie today space jack
we're thinking of giving you a promotion
a promotion that's wrong wow if you turn
around and look at those doors that are
right behind you
that's the promotion room space jack
just
walk right on through and we'll turn you
into a much better movie okay
you'd like that wouldn't you oh i'm
excited to go right through those
stories huh
now it's time for your promotion
i can see you being a star wars or maybe
if you play your cards right even a 2001
a space artist all right space jack
time for your promotion
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha
ha
hello it's me red letter media while we
were filming our episode of best of the
worst recently
i noted i think the cameras were off at
the time
i noted something very special about the
space jacked vhs cover this is
obviously a re-issue probably came out
in the 90s
i don't know but i noticed something
interesting about the cover
which we talked about off-camera i had
made a mental note to bring it up in the
discussion but i totally
forgot to but on the space jacked cover
the spaceship that appears is not the
spaceship in the film
but it is in fact an upside down
romulan warbird ripped off from star
trek the next generation
mixed with some other kind of spaceshipy
components
so uh jay the editor of the segment will
show
in detail a side-by-side comparison
you're probably looking at it now
of the space jack cover and
this which is a romulan warbird
oh mike but it's green that's why i'm
putting in front of my chest you stupid
idiot
