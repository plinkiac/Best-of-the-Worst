Rich: So, Josh!
Josh: Yeah?
R: Did you know that in the [long bleep] wearing a [long bleep] and it [long bleep] you know, would you like [bleep]
JH: Oh, that’s neat!
R: Int that--int that great?
JH: Yeah, that’s really fun, I mean I’m glad that like [long bleep] 
R: Yeah
JH: And, uh, [long bleep] 
R: You could see the whole--the whole [bleep] 
JH: No! So, yeah like the whole [long bleep]
R: Like, like--
JH: Just really [bleep]
R: Everyone?
JH: Right there…
R: Like, like [Does cutting throat motion] [bleep] Like that?
JH: You get every little [bleep] Like every, like [bleep] And this one [bleep] You know, so you got the [long bleep] in the frame there, like, [bleep] 
[Rich pretends to shoot himself in the head, his head becomes pixelated] 
JH: Ridiculous ha--[extra long bleep] 
R: Right in the he--[bleep]
JH: And they’re kinda [bleep] 
R: It’s gonna be a large group of people, I’m sure everyone’s gonna have fun
JH: Oh, I’m sure--I’m sure--I’m sure they will, I’m sure it’s gonna be a great time
R: So! Uh--Ja…? J--Josh!
JH: Right! 
R: It’s time for another Best of the Worst
JH: Yeah!
R: What are we watching today?
JH: Well, this is episode 1 of a brand new subseries. You’re familiar with our Selection series, I’m sure
R: Of course, of course 
JH: This is the Remote Selection series, where we watch movies that someone picked that’s not even here [Silence]
R: We--we need a new series for that? Can’t we just...watch the movies? As if it were a normal episode? Why does everything have to be a fucking gimmick? [Looks behind the camera] Would you have a normal fucking episode? Wheel, Plinketto, Selection--Premium Sh--sh--
JH: Just read that, just read it
R: Read the fucking box like it’s a normal goddamn episode!
JH: Fine, read it, fine, fine
[Rich looks at the cover]
R: The Sweeper [The Sweeper title card appears] With C. Thomas Howell. They’re not--they’re not very famous, but their name’s on the top of the box
JH: Not very famous, you say? [Plays clip of the guy(?)]
R: [Reads the tagline] “Either you’re in...or in the way
JH: Oooh
R: That’s--that’s something a 12 year old thought was badass [Josh laughs] “Mark Goddard is an angry LA cop with a “perchant” for violence,” that was a fancy…”perchant” [Best of the Worst Fun Fact appears, reading: “Perchant” is not a real word] “He has an infamous temper”
JH: Oh
R: “And his prisoners are known for having ‘deadly’ accidents. But when Mark is recruited by Justice Incorporated…”
JH: Seriously?
R: “...a secret police society whose agents are known as Sweepers, he’s…”
JH: Ahhh
R: Yeah, he’s a sweeper
JH: [Nods] Okay. Okay, I get it 
R: That’s--the--they’re so awesome they get their own special name for what they are, like...vigilantes or something. “He’s suddenly has to use his rogue justice to survive” 
JH: [Laughs] Okay
R: That--that last sentence is amazing, and it also makes no sense

[3:39] Mike: She said, “do you wanna make love? I wanna C. Thomas Howell”
Jay: Pfff [Laughs] 
R: Ughhhhhhh
J: That was a good joke
R: Uh. Uh
J: I like that one
M: It was more embarrassing

[4:02] JH: Our second selection is...Empire of the Dark [Empire of the Dark title card appears] 
R: Oh, that’s a nice-looking, like, rat demon thing
JH: It’s pretty cool
R: Huh
JH: Like, I’m kind of into this-- 
R: That won’t be in the movie [Plays clip of the demon, BotW Fun Fact appears, saying: That was in the movie]
JH: That looks like the dogs from Ghostbusters, a little bit. Probably not in the movie, you’re right [BotW Fun Fact appears again] Uh, Richard Harrison, though, definitely in the movie. You might remember him as Mr. Blood Debts
R: Oh god, that’s great, what’s wrong with his legs? [Josh looks at the cover] Look at him, look at him [Crouches like the man on the cover, Josh laughs] 
JH: Well, that’s, oh wow. Yeah, this is already great [Points to a still on the back cover]
R: Okay
JH: Solid VHS capture there [Rich chuckles] That’s gonna be good. Uh, “a private detective searching for a killer comes across a Satanic cult from another dimension, monsters called up from Hell, and murderous ninja assassins”
R:...Okay. I’m down with this
JH: That’s--that’s the entirety of the description
R: Unless they’re trying for comedy…Then it’ll be terrible
JH: Naw, no, not with Richard Harrison, he doesn’t do funny, I don’t think. I don’t think he knows what funny is

[5:46] JH: And our final movie for the evening, Rich, I’m very excited...this is a movie called Mad Foxes [Hands Rich the case] Please, tell me all about Mad Foxes, I’m fucking psyched
R: I’ll have to tell you about it because we cannot show you this cover [Censored cover and title card appears] “Fewer of Rahder...Stingray 2”
JH: Okay
R: Okay, uh...here’s the description
JH: Yeah
R: “Per...Der Playboy Hal ist schwer reich und ‘geseit’ sein Leben in vollen Zügen. Sein ganzer Stolz ist ein weißer, uh, Stingray mit dem er Frauen abschleppt. Eines Abends ist er mit Babsy unterwegs, um ‘germanish’”
JH: Babsy?
R: “Ihren ‘gutenstag’ zu feiern. Auf dem Weg zur Disco wind Hal von einer Bande ‘Nazi-Motordocker’ zu einem Wettrennen überredet, welches für einen der Rocker...”
JH: Welch’s? [Picture of Welch’s juice appears] 
R: Hmm mhm, Welch’s. “Der Rocker tödlich endet. Hal und Babsy stören sich nicht sonderlich daran und feiern weiter als wäre nichts ‘gescheshen’”
JH: Gescheshen
R: “Auf dem Weg nach House werden die beiden von der Gang ‘abergafangen’....Babsy wird, uh, vergo--”
JH: Oh my God
R: “‘Vergovaltrig’ und Hal verprugelt”
JH: Blblbl
R: “Er stinnt auf Rache und ‘schalagt’ ‘zuaummen’ [bleep] seinen Kumpels von der Kampfsportschule zurück. Nach und nach ‘deziren’ sich beiden ‘sesen’ und [bleep] fließt das blut ‘geich’ kübelweise” 
JH: [Sighs] Such a beautiful language

[7:54] J: Is he bathing in piss?
JH: Oh NO!
M: He peed in the bathtub
J: Why is that bathtub…?
JH: Awwww! Gross!
J: What the fuck!
M: He’s like a--he’s like a pee fetishist
J: Yeah. “Fuck me in this piss”

[8;25] [A guy gets blown up]
JH: Wow
M: Oh
JH: He disappeared [Jay laughs]
R: That’s kinda cute [Jay and Josh laugh]
J: I’m glad the movie won you over, Rich 

[8:40] M: Well. This episode was a bunch of bad movies. It was a--it was a festival of crap. In fact...you could call it…--[Puts a bottle of Tums on the table]--a Tums festival...of crap
J: Is that a reference to something?
M:....No
[Rich pours out some Tums into his hand and eats them]
J: Rich is having a Tums festival
JH: Oh wow
J: These things are dangerous, if you take too many of them, Rich….
M: You really do four of those at a time?
JH: That was more than four, it was five or six [Mike watches Rich eat Tums with a concerned expression on his face] “Do not take more than 7 tablets in 24 hours.” Watch it
R: Oh, please
JH: “If pregnant do not take more than 5 tablets in 24 hours.” Watch it [Mike drops his bottle on the ground, Jay laughs, Josh throws the bottle of Tums on the table, it flips over, opens, and falls to the ground]
J: Oh noooo!
M: Now that’s a Tums festival
R: Those are my actual Tums, Josh
JH: I’m sorry, I’m really sorry 
M: Don’t worry about it, Josh, you just saved Rich’s life, he’s poppin’ 38 of those a day
JH: Ohh
M: His stomach’s gonna eat itself. Anyways…
J: What do you do if your stomach is upset from too many Tums, what do you take?
M: You take, uh, uh, spicy food [Jay and Rich laugh]
JH: You just--you--you just drink some vinegar
J: Okay [Chuckles]
M: You have a chimichanga, with extra hot sauce, evens it out
R: Pepperoni pizza will get that right out 
J: Sure, sure
M: Well, I’m done introing 
J: Alright. Uh, we watched three films, I don’t think we explained this in the intro. That this is the Subselection series, but all three of these were selected by Colin from Canada. Colin from Canada is responsible for us watching Mad Foxes
M: Apparently he’s intro flaccid penises and rape

[10:45] M: And then the cops say, “hey, look at those minorities standing on the pier. They may or may not, but most likely may be drug dealers”
JH: Well, there’s one guy that’s just clearly a P.A. that somebody gave a long leopard print trench coat to
M: Yeah. One was dressed like a pimp, anyways, so he comes out and goes “you can’t sell drugs here on this pier,” and then they get into a--a--a--a confrontation, and then a 30-minute long wacky chase sequence occurs on the pier
J: If by “wacky” you mean “awesome” 
[Plays clip of chase]
[In the screening room]
JH: Woah-ho-ho!
J: Jesus!
JH: This is--
J: Wow! So many people are getting hit by that car [Rich laughs, then Jay]
JH: How did they get--there through all of this shit?
M: How long is this pier? [Rich and Jay laugh]
[At the table] 
J: It’s not really a pier, it’s just a circle
M: It never ends
J: Apparently. This pier just keeps going
R: It’s the Transcontinental Pier
J: It’s kind of like the Mall of America, where it’s like, it’s really big, but it’s the same three stores over and over [Rich laughs]
JH: Yeah
J: Because there’s just endless popcorn stands [Plays clips of popcorn stands getting run over] 
JH: Yeah
J: Those beanie babies are just flying everywhere [Cop stands on his motorcycle while driving it]
Jay and Josh: Whaaaat!
M: Oh my god, what an adventure
R: [Laughs] What! Nooo, what!
JH: Oh my goodneeeesss [Cop flings himself at the car he’s chasing, Jay laughs]
J: This is amazing
[At the table]
R: I--I was getting Blues Brothers vibes
J: Oh, sure, yeah
R: There’s a cop car driving through a mall
J: Yeah, yeah [Alternates playing clips from The Sweeper and Blues Brothers]
M: The people on the end of the pier with the folding tables had about 25 minutes to get out of the way [Josh and Rich laugh]
J: “Those--those cars way down there, they’re heading in this direction, let’s move” 
M: Looks like it’s just driving through everyone and everything. Cop dad gets on a motorcycle and leaps onto the car, with the kid still in the back seat
JH: He pops so many wheelies before that [Jay laughs] Just poppin’ all the wheelies
R: How often do you get to a high-speed car chase on a bike, you have to pop the wheelie
M: But the chase ends with the cop car going off the edge off the pier into the water [Plays clip]
JH: Apparently the guy is not in there anymore
J: Yeah, where’d he go?
JH: I don’t know
J: He dissolved when he hit the water
JH: Oh no, he’s soluble [Jay laughs] It’s hard to run a crime syndicate when all your men are made out of salt

[17:26] JH: All of this takes way too fucking long, by the way
J: Yeah, this is like the first, like, 40 minutes of the movie
JH: Yeah, and this should be taken care of, like, almost immediately
R: There are...four? action scenes before we are introduced to that main plot
JH: Yeah, there’s way too much…
R: Pier, family murdered, uh, hanging the mugger, and beating up the child molester
J: Chi--well, child pornographer, Rich
JH: Child pornographer
R: Yeah. Hand in hand, really [Jay chuckles] 
JH: Okay, there’s something more important that happens when he joins Justice Incorporated--it’s Justice Incorporated?
J: “Justice Incorporated”
JH: Okay, it’s that he becomes indes--
R: Who aren’t an actual corporation, because I don’t know how the hell you legally set that up [Jay laughs] “Yeah, we’re a corporation who murders, uh, criminals who have not been convicted of crimes”
JH: I guess it sounds better than Justice Unincorporated? I--
J: Pffftftfftf!
R: “Justice Underground”
M: It was a little more, uh, subtle than Dirty Cops, Inc. [Rich and Josh burst into laughter] That was our first name
JH: Yeah, I’m done getting the visions of this brainstorming session in my head now
M: “What about Dirty Cops, Inc?”
JH: Ehh, didn’t play so well
J: “If we called it that, people might think we’re dirty cops!” 
JH: “Well, we are dirty cops”
R: That sounds like a failed 90s comic book, “Justice Inc”? I--it…
JH: Yeah
R: You need--you need a title that sounds more like a secret organization, like “The All Seeing Eye”
M: Yeah, yeah
JH: Yeah. They didn’t have time for that in this movie, they were just like, “Justice Incorporated,” whatever
J: Or--or you operate out of the back of like a, like a bakery, and you just use the name of the baking company [Rich laughs] Then no one’s gonna suspect you of anything 
JH: Yeah, that’s true
R: Oh, no, no--[Stutters]--a company, that, they bag the ice, and “Just Ice”
J: Ohhhh, that’s perfect! That’s the perfect cover, Rich!
R: The logo--[Josh and Jay laugh]--the logo on the bag of ice, the manufacturer, it’d just be a gun [Jay laughs]
JH: Not even doing that great of a job with this one….
M: They’re so weird…”Justice…”
J: “Ice...Incorporated”
M: “I’ll have a 10-pound bag”
J: “Oh, we don’t sell ice” [Rich chuckles]
M: “We’re all outta ice”

[21:18] R: Pull over, you’re fucking drunk! (?)

[21:32] M: I think this movie was like a propane safety video

[24:18] R: That man was barely on Star Trek. Calling him Star Trek Guy, I somewhat object to that

[27:40] J: You can’t have any sympathy for a guy wearing a House of Pain hat [Rich and Mike chuckle and snicker]
JH: Whoa
J: That’s--that’s what my dad always told me
M: Sage advice

[30:10] M: A mild-mannered tax accountant by day, and action star by day for night [Everyone laughs, Mike looks at the camera]
J: Bam! [Explosion goes off]
M: Joke of the show! 
JH: Worth it!
J: Nailed it! 
R: Y--y--you did it, Mike, you over--you overcame your earlier attempt at Joke of the Show
JH: You did it. You did it!
M: I failed with my Milli Vanilli tweet joke
[In the screening room]
M: Oh my god, it’s Milli Vanilli! I don’t keep up with Milli Vanilli….I’m gonna follow them on Twitter [Silence] I followed them on Twitter but then I found out it was a fake account 
J: Pffff!
JH: Ehh...uh…
M: Ehh?
R: I got--you get a smile [Rich claps, Mike stands up and bows, Josh and Jay laugh] That got the “not quite the” joke of the episode 

[34:46] M: I know we talked a lot during the film, which is a detriment to us discussing the film. [Jay laughs] But did they ever say what the ultimate goal of their--
J: I think they said something about them taking over Earth
M: Just like--[Overlapping dialogue]
JH: --releasing the demon
M: So...
R: Well, the demons could apparently leave, though
JH: Yeah! That is why--[Josh and Jay speak at the same time]
M: Maybe the hole would get bigger [Rich laughs] And let out more demons 
JH: You know what? You’re right actually, because at the end he’s still struggling to get out of that hole [Plays clips of the demon trying to fit through the hole]
J: Even though he’s already been out before
JH: That is what I would call a plot hole
J:...Hmm, literally a plot hole [Rich and Mike play a rimshot on the table] (?)
JH: Ohhh boy
M: Now I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of terrible jokes. [Josh and Jay laugh] Usually I’m on the giving end of them
R: That joke was like getting onto first on, like, an error [Baseball Joke Count: 3 appears on screen] It went through--it went, like, through the (?) the ball and dropped it, then you got on first
JH: You don’t feel that great about it, but you’re on base
J: Yeah
M:....I was gonna make a baseball joke, believe it or not
R: Yeah?
M: Yeah, I was gonna say Steve Bartek is just a huge fuck-up. [Nobody speaks] He--he once tried to catch that baseball at the Cubs game [The baseball joke count goes up]
JH: Yeow
R: Ohhhhhhhhhhh
JH: That’s a reference to an old thing
J: That’s a joke that we need to have an entire title crawl to explain
M: I needed to find the right spot to squeeze it in, but it wasn’t happening
R: They had to smug--smuggle Steve Bartman out of Frigley Field dressed like a security guard because the fans were going to murder him [Plays clip of the incident]
Commentator: That’s awfully close to fan interference right there
M: They also had to smuggle him out of Frigley Wrield, too
