Mike: What? What is that, a comic book? Jesus Christ, comic book nerds be all up in this place! What is this crap? [Looks at the cover] Batman and the Ninja Turtles? How fucking lame! Why don’t you read a real book, with words instead of pictures? [Freddie lowers the book] You stupid asshole--oh!! Why, it’s Freddie Williams, he’s come to visit us! Welcome, to Best of the Worst. Why, hello Freddie! Welcome back to Milwaukee! Uh, I loved your comic book. Which--whichever one that you drew
Freddie: Oh, the Batman/Ninja Turtle one?
Mike: Yes
Freddie: Oh
M: It was excellent, I loved the parts that had Batman in it, and the parts that had Ninja Turtles
Freddie: Those were my favorite parts, too
M: There--there was--ssss--very good, excellent in fact, but today we’re here to watch movies!
Freddie: Yes
M: And this episode actually is gonna be the first of what we’re gonna call...our Selection Series. Selection Series episode number 1. And Freddie is gonna be our first selector, which means he has chosen the three films that we’re gonna watch today
Freddie: Yes. Super excited about this
M: You will either have all of the--the glory...
Freddie: Hmm hmm
M: Or all of the blame
F: Okay. Not as--as excited about the second part, I don’t want the blame
M: Our first film...that Freddie has selected is Biohazard [Biohazard title card appears] Uh, now, any particular reason why you picked this film?
F: The stringent criteria that I used to pick all 3 of the films is based on, uh...what everyone should base their movie selection on, which is the cover art! Of course. Uh, I thought that this looked like early Nintendo Metroid illustrations or something, for, like, the original 8-bit NES, so, that’s why it stood out to me and I grabbed it
M: So you are advocating to judge books by their covers?
F: Yes, or VHS by their covers, definitely 
M: Ok
F: Yeah
M: That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen [Freddie laughs] Um, now let’s check this out, [Looks at the tape’s spine] this is--this is by “Men...Mintex”? Entertainment, which is not a word, M-N-T-E-X
F: Uh huh
M: I don’t know if that’s an acronym. Uh, from Prior Lake, Minnesota, which is...also known as, uh, the Hollywood of Prior Lake, Minnesota [Freddie laughs] Um--
F: These are signs of quality 
M: These are signs of qua--exactly, yes. “A group of skeptical...government officials headed by General Randolph are brought to a remote laboratory for a demonstration in,” quote, “Psychic Materialization”
F: Okay
M: So it’s like making things appear with your mind? That’s what it sounds like literally
F: Uh, yes. Yeah, bringing them into reality. To  materialize
M: There’s a lady on the back who has...a giant Louis Tully hat
F: Uh huh. That looks like Spacegirl. Uh, with the helmet and stuff, um, so I’m on board for this 
M: “But the project scientists had warned that not enough testing had been completed to access safety concerns”! Wh--which means, something bad will materialize, perhaps a biohazard
F: Uh huh
Scientist: Her mental energy will receive and transmit, to this location, anything that her mind can attract
Man: This I’ve got to see
[The scientist turns on the machine, the woman imagines space]
M: Oh. What? [Rich laughs]
Jay: She’s envisioning the universe?
[Overlapping dialogue]
F: Maybe she’s pulling something from the astral plane or something
M: Yeah
R: She’s pulling in an alien with her brain?
M: [Continues to read the back of the box] Uh, “in a freak accident during the demonstration--” they’re just telling us the plot
F: Hmm mhm
M: Uhhh “the politici--”
F: [Robotically] How much text is there?
M: “A vicious creature is created!”
F: Yaaaay
M: Um, “unable to contain the monster, it unleashes unbelievable havoc and destruction against mankind!” 
F: Awesome
M: Wow, that’s a lot of havoc and destruction
F: [Nods] All of mankind?
M: This is a very, very efficient creature
F: Around the planet?
M: He’s like Santa Claus
[Guy almost touches a dead creature on the ground]
Medic: Hey! Don’t touch that thing!. It’s a biohazard
F: Oh
M: Oh
F: They said the name of the film 
J: Uh--[Jay and Rich laugh] God
F: Yes, it’s unconvincing 
M: [Continues reading] “Reproducing itself at an alarming rate,” oh my god!
F: Hopefully we’ll...that’ll be full frontal and on screen [Cuts to a clip of an alien(?) jerking off] What? Wait...
M: I think we have more of a Gremlins-y situation
F: Okay
M: Wh--wh--where it reproduces kind of like that as opposed to, uh, a sexual act
F: Right
M: I--I was also looking forward to seeing a sexual act with the biohazard creature [Freddie chuckles] Or mi--maybe minds? Psychic minds make more biohazards--
F: Materializes more copies of themselves?
M: We don’t--we just don’t know what to expect with this. Uhh…”and all known weapons...seemingly powerless against the creatures”
[An old couple drives on a dark road, the woman nags the old man]
[Nobody in the screening room speaks]
R: Oh god! [Jay laughs]
[The biohazard creature appears in front of the car, Rich laughs]
J: Oh no!!
F: Mess up that truck!
R: [Laughs] Oh!
M: “The scientists are gravely concerned”............
F: What was that, an ellipsis?
M: No
F: Oh
M: I just stopped reading the sentence
F: Okay [Laughs]
M: Mid-sentence for not reason, um…
F: You’ve hit your character limit?
M: Yes. I would be gravely concerned at the, multiplying monster problem
F: Hmm mhm
M: Especially when one monster threatens all of mankind, when you have multiples of them
F: Yeah
M: You got a serious fucking problem
F: It just gets slightly worse, if one is going to threaten all of mankind, the second one you’re like, “okay, well, we’re already already threatened, so…”
M: Right [Looks at the tape] Um...yeah, that’s like the--you know, most of your house is on fire, there’s an extra little fire in the corner, you’re not gonna, you know--
F: A duplicate?
M: Yeah. Just an extra tiny fire. Yeah. This could be a disaster on a scale of biohazard...movie

[6:37] J: Well, Freddie! Uh, as you can probably tell from my t-shirt, my favorite genre of film is weepy melodramas [Freddie chuckles] But for some reason the next movie you picked is a horror  film
F: Yes
J: Called Slaughter High 
F: Yeah [Slaughter High title card appears] 
J: [Reads the tagline] “Marty majored in cutting classmates...” So we’re off to a good start, I think
F: I didn’t even read that far--[Jay laughs]--it was just, the criteria was awesome box art 
J: This is--yeah--this is--this is a good pick, this is, uh, I think, somewhat of a cult classic, this movie, although I’ve never seen it
F: Okay
J: I know very little about it, but why don’t you uh, you read the box and tell us about--
F: Uh oh
J:--Slaughter High? [Hands over the tape]
F: Okay. Alright, uh, it says “t here’s horror in the halls,” I just wanted to point that out, “T” is very separate from “here’s” [Jay laughs] Alright, so, “there’s horror in the halls,” dot dot dot, hah, “lynching in the lunchroom...murder in metal shop. Welcome to Slaughter High...where the students are dying to get out”
J: This--all this stuff is gonna be...the extent of their creativity with the movie, isn’t it?
F: “Marty was the nerd everyone made fun of. All the jocks and pretty girls teased, taunted, and tortured him mercilessly. Things went too far when one of their jokes backfired, disfiguring Marty for life”
(...)
J: Is that--is that...Prom Night? Or Terror Train that has, like, that exact same plot?
F: Oh
J: Where someone gets--gets bullied and then turns into a killer
F: I don’t know, I don’t know movies, uh, “it’s five years later and Marty is throwing a reunion for all his high high school ‘friends.’ Does he have a surprise for them?” Oh, I’m sorry. There’s no a--there’s no question mark [Jay laughs] “Does he ha--”
J: Oh, so it’s like, “does he have a surprise for them!”
F: Yeah, “does he have a surprise for them!”
J: Okay
F: “The prom queen, the jock, the class clown, the--busybody?” Yeah, that’s, like, a typical genre of person [Jay huffs] Okay, “the busybody, the rebel, and a few select others, have all been invited to Marty’s gala of gore”
[Plays clip]
Rich: You haven’t caught on to the fact that something very weird is going on yet? [Jay laughs] 
F: “Five years ago, Marty got mad. Now he’s going to get even. In one riot of a reunion”
J: This sounds like pretty classic slasher movie stuff. It’s The Breakfast Club. With a slasher 
F: Oh. That sounds awesome
J: I can get behind that
F: [Looks at the cover] I like it that in the--in the reflection they didn’t accidentally paint the camera...‘Cause I’m sure--[Jay laughs] I’m sure they had, like--
J: What--what is in there? [Overlapping dialogue] Oh, it’s just his hand, okay
F: That’s pretty cool-looking
J: Well, this movie is released through the classic Vestron Video, uh, home video line. Uh, so expectations are high for Slaughter High

[10:14] R: Okay, Freddie, so the last tape that you have selected
F: Yes
R: And this is all on you
F: Hmmm
R: Is Kill Point [Kill Point title card appears] So, tell us why you chose to select Kill Point
F: Well, uh, there’s two [Points to the numbers on the cover] one, two, three reasons, I’m gonna have to think of a third, actually, I only had two, it’s--one is that the, uh, the, the box art is actually pretty cool, I like the painted quality of it. Heavily referenced, but well executed. Uh, and two: the cast! The cast has Cameron Mitchell, and it has Richard Roundtree, and it has other people in it, too. Uh….
R: Other--other people?
F: Yeah, other people. Um...but the back of it does have an awesome piece of clip art of a gun [Shows the gun on the back] That’s not painted--
R: Pfffff--[Laughs]
F: That’s cool (?)
R: But, uh, [Points to one of the names on the back] Leo Fong
[Plays clip]
[In the screening room]
R: Why is his face flat? [Mike laughs]
M: He’s so bad! 
R: [Reading the back] “Joe Marks (Cameron Mitchell)” so he’s--he’s--he’s top billed
F: Yes
R: So he’s gonna be in the movie for two minutes. “And Nighthawk (Stack Pierce),” never heard of that fucker, he’s gonna be in the whole fucking film [Freddie laughs] “steal enough machine guns, grenades, and rocket launchers to outfit a small army from the National Guard Armory. When the word hits the streets, criminals and gangs from all walks of life surface to buy the black market artillery to build up their own private arsenals
[Criminals shoot up a restaurant filled with adults and children, Rich chuckles and smiles]
R: “The result is a brutal killing spree that takes LA by the throat! To combat the relentless wave of violence, a special task force is formed by Police Special Agent Bill Bryant (Richard Roundtree) and Lieutenant James Long (Leo Fong). Follow the trail of blood as the two law enforcers fight violence with violence and declare war on an unstoppable army--”
F: Yes!
R:”--of sadistic assassins!”
F: Yes!
R: That sounds great!

[13:16] R: Mike, you’re doing a terrible intro. I--ai--ai--I’m starting to think we should give it back to Jay

[14:13] [Freddie talks about the first movie’s cover, Mike turns to Rich]
M: He looks terrible 

[14:30] M: Alienator sounds like a fast food sandwich that you would buy at Wendy’s [Everyone chuckles] I don’t know, doesn’t it?
J: Well, there’s…
R: [Stammers] It’d have, like, a gimmick, like, a bun that was dyed green
J: There you go, yeah yeah yeah yeah
F: Or a lot of onions so your breath would be terrible, and it would alienate you from the group [Rich laughs loudly]
M: “You wa--you want no one to talk to you at that party you’re going to?”
R: Onions and beans [Fart sound effect plays]
M: Onions and beans, onions and beans [Fart plays again]
F: You’d have a cloud around you
J: So you’re smelling from both ends, is what you’re saying

[15:19] M: Very Galaxy Invader
J: Yes, Galaxy Invader, uhh, Alienator, a little bit
M: A little bit of Baconator

[16:27] F: So, in the small, cramped control room, somebody in our group shouted out something about deodorant
M: Yeah! That was me
F: And you were prescient, because, right after that, somebody said “I thought I smelled something, oh, that was my deodorant”
M: Yeah
F: So, it was a joke for us, but for them it was serious dialogue, I think?
[Some men walk into a stuffed control room]
[In the screening room] 
M: Oh my god, how many people can they fit in this frame? [Rich and Jay laugh] Yeah, “I hope everybody’s wearing your deodorant”
Man: You wanna know something?
Guy: What?
Man: [Sniffs] You deodorant ain’t getting the job done
J: Eyyyy, a deodorant reference, it happened
[At the table]
R: Well, we all have the power of psychic materialization
M: Yes
F: Oh
M: We--we think something...and then it happens in the film
F: Okay
M: Rich Evans is the strongest…[Jay and Rich laugh] He has the strongest of this power
J: He has the highest midichlorian count?
M: Yes, although, I am--I am--I am his padawan learner [Rich laughs] and my--my poison(?) Pabst Blue Ribbon psychic premonition came true in this, which is rare for me
J: Yeah
M: But I’m still learning. I’m still learning the arts
F: A chupa chowa(?) but there was a lot of trucks [Jay laughs and covers his face]...in this film
R: I’m using my powers to hold you back [Everyone chuckles]
F: To cloud his mind?
M: ‘Cause I will only use them for evil?
R: [Laughs] It’s for the greater good of the world

[20:55] R: Now, now, it is a nice-looking costume, but they fucked up the reveal again and we get another coupon shot
J: Yes, just ope--there it is
R: [Huffs, turns to the camera] TM 
[Coupon Shot™ appears on screen] 

[21:44] M: And then the alien is…comes out from the ceiling and, uhh...much better done in Alien 
[Silence]
J: Oh, in Alien?
M: Yes
J: Oh

[24:03] R: It didn’t--it didn’t die. It was unconscious for a bit, but…[Mike begins to talk] Unconsc-iss? Unconscious. Unconscious [Mike gets weirded out and stops talking]
M: The fuck is wrong with you? 
R: I’m trying to say a word right
F: I think you said it right, didn’t you?
J: He said it right the first time
R: I said “iss” the first time, “unconsc-iss,” it’s “unconsc-uss” [Camera focuses on Jay and Freddie]
J:.....That’s the same thing
M: What?
R: Uss, iss
M: What?
R: Uss iss at the end
M: What?
R: Unconsc-uss
M: What?
R: Unconsc-iss
J: See, none of us would’ve noticed that you said it wrong, but now you’ve drawn so much attention to it
M: And you know--I--don’t worry, Rich, I’ll edit all of this out
J: Yeah
[Rich looks at Mike and smiles]
R: You mean in? Repeatedly? [Everyone snickers] With jump cuts? And--and--and text on the bottom?
M: A picture of your...your driver’s license [Jay laughs] 
R: When I’m--when I’m in the middle of saying iss and then you just gotta freeze-frame on my face awkwardly, and zoom in?
M: [Laughs] Ye--yeah, yeah [Replays Rich saying iss] Yeah, yeah, probably all that, plus more
J: Yeah
M: It...plus a lot more
R: There gonna be, like a, like a caption overhead, “Rich Evans is a dumbass,” little arrow pointing at me?
M: Not a little arrow [Jay laughs] So many arrows!
F: It’s ok, buddy
M: You’re like a, like a--a--a--a court jester. Only--only, an embarrassing court jester

[27:03] F: So, the one plot point that they actually follow through on, is essentially the psychic, the young lady...
M: Young in a cosmic, uh, timeline
J: Ok. Right
M: Like, age of the universe timeline
J: Sure, sure
F: Um…
M: Big Bang young [Jay chuckles]
F: Big Bang young...um...that could be a porn star name but she basically, her and Han Solo--
[Rich bursts out laughing, Big Bang Yung is written on screen under a picture of an Asian porn star(?)] 

[33:05] R: Did they, like, hosing him down with, like, the fire extinguisher--ishka--extinguisher, too, or…?
F: Yes, they are. They--they use a fire extinguisher, but do you wanna say that again?
R:..Eh….
M: Nah, it’s stayin’ in
R: You know what? It’s fine [Jay laughs] 
M: Don’t worry
R: [Jerks a thumb towards Mike] It’s--it’s fine, I know what’s gonna happen [Replays Rich mispronouncing extinguisher]
M: Why would you assume I would do it again? [Replays it again]
F: If I was editing it, you would’ve....you--your--your words would sound perfect [Rich, Jay, and Freddie laugh]
R: You’d--you’d--you’d, like, awkwardly take out the vowels that are right and rearrange them? [They chuckle] Me saying--me saying one word would be, like, eight jump cuts. FI--re--EX--tin--gui--SHER! [They laugh]
M: “Rich is--Rich is so well spoken in this episode!”

[42:18] M: That’s before Max Landis is hung….I’m sorry, hanged by...our killer
[Replays Mike saying “Max Landis is hung” multiple times with a heart with Max’s face in it on screen, “special guest editor: Rich Evans” appears] 

[47:02] M: Only filthy Americans would just wash the blood off their face. The Brits, full bath. Right in the tub. Head to toe, just in case the Queen shows up
R: Only once a month, though [Jay laughs]
M: Only once a month. No no no no no no no, that’s--
J: That’s brushing their teeth
M: I was just about go say that!
J: Oh nooooooo!!

[49:30] R: Wasn’t it the most upsetting thing in the world when Leo Fong successfully parked a car?
M: It was [Jay laughs] It really was [To the camera] If you’re confused at all about what we’re talking about, check out this episode [Thumbnail for the Low Blow episode appears] Don’t forget to click subscribe and like
J: Smash that like button!
M: Smash that like button and follow us on Twitter, and Facebook, and Instagram [Makes a face of disgust]
J: So you mentioned Low Blow is buff in this movie. He’s got some muscles!
R: He’s--he’s--he’s a tough-lookin’ dude
J: He’s got muscles, and he has Uma Thurman’s hair from Pulp Fiction. Which is very off putting
R: I was thinking Conan, like classic kind of comic book Conan
J: Okay, sure
R: Yeah, he’s, he’s a pretty buff dude, he’s in good shape, it’s just a shame about his face though
M: He’s a butterface? 
R: He’s got--he’s got a--
J: Did you say he’s a butterface? Did you call Low Blow a butterface?
M: Rich doesn’t know what that means [Jay laughs and covers his face]
R: I don’t know what that means
M: No, see, he doesn’t know [Jay laughs]
F: I’ll explain it. It usually is used if a woman is very attractive in all ways but her face
R: Oh! Ok
F: So, butterface
R: Ohhhh
J: Like, super hot body, but her face….
M: She’s got a butterface
J: Yes. They’d say she has a butterface
R: I’d a--I’d almost call it, like, a Frankenstein face because it looks like he’s got eyes...eyes from two different corpses…..it’s just that dead, vacant stare
M: And Tommy Lee Jones’ beautiful skin
F: And there are some deep, lingering, luscious closeups of his face

[54:19] M: Game of Wicker Thrones

[1:02:05] M: We found ourselves rooting for Cameron Mitchell to murder a woman and a baby. That’s the dark place this movie took us

[1:05:30] M: It’s...straight up bizarre…..So now’s the time of the night when we pick our Best of the Worst. I will move left to right, starting from Rich Evans, uh, ending with our selector, who will be the--could be the deciding vote, Rich Evans…[Coughs, cuts to Rich talking]

[1:0:35] M: Kill Point was 100% class [Everyone chuckles]
J: Or 0% class
M: It was...it was a big piece of shit, but at the same time...it knew it was just so cool, I can see this being on, uh...many people’s top 10 lists of best films of all time [Rich laughs] I ju--I just loved it, I loved it, it was--it--
R: Mike has been drinking
