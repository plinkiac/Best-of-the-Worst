Rich: So, welcome to the Great White North! [Reaches for the tape] Our first movie today is Parole Violators
Colin: Oooh
[Parole Violators title card appears]
R: Would--would you like to tell us about Parole Violators? [Hands Colin the tape]
C: Absolutely. So, Parole Violators. “Sean Donahue stars as Myles Long….”
R: Oh my god, is this a porno?
C: Ah….We’ll find out. uh--[Rich covers his face]--”ex-cop and current vigilante in this action thriller, Long has been dismissed from the police force for using violent tactics, and now spends his days tracking down parole violators and filming their discretions…” Shouldn’t it be “indiscretions”?
R: It should be
C: Okay...I don’t know
R: [Stutters] He’s just filming them discreetly
C: Maybe they’re bei--
R: Through windows
C: Maybe they’re being discreet and then he’s filming them, okay
[In the screening room] 
R: Something--something’s gonna happen
[Thug punches man in the back during a robbery, Rich and Colin chuckle]
R: “Ohh, my back! Oof”
C: Ooh
[Main character watches the robbery from afar]
R: Has he got a power glove? 
Mike: No, he’s recording on a video camera
R: Okay
M: Remember he’s recording discretions [Rich chuckles] 
[In the VHS room] 
C: [Continues reading the back] Umm, “as evidence to put them behin--uh, back behind bars. When Chino, the psychotic child molester that ultimately--[Rich facepalms, hangs his head, and leaves]--led to Myles’ dismissal from the force, is paroled…” oh god… “while--” this is gonna--
R: I’m through with rape!
C: [Laughs] That was in the past, though--[Rich comes back]--hopefully he’s not gonna rape any children in the movie
(...)
[2:22] [Rich comes back] 
R: Oh no…
C: “With Tracy anxious to join Myles on it--” we still don’t know who Tracy is, “with Tracy anxious to join Myles on his mission, the two head out to get back her daughter and end Chino’s criminal ways once and for all. Replete with fantastic martial arts action, gun battles, explosions, and a vast array of stunts, Parole Violators is one of the few film...that actually delivers on its promise of…” quote, unquote “non-stop action.” So much of a promise when you put it in quotes
R: We--we--we--we have a movie about a child molester with a main character called Myles Long [Colin laughs] Nothing about this is good!

[3:28] C: Ah….”may contain scenes of violence or adult themes” [Rich hangs his head and walks away again] “Features...standard full frame...color!.......Interactive menus”?

[4:02] M: Ohh--
Jim: Hi Mike!
M: Hi Jim
JM: How are you?
M: I’m fantastic
JM: Good, did--do you wanna watch a movie?
M: Yes, let’s--let’s see what our second film is
JM: [Picks up the tape] Uh, the second film is David Carradine in Future Force
[Future Force title card appears] 
M: Oh my god, look at that arm
JM: It looks...really good, it’s, I think, bionic.”Robbery, $10,000, murder, $50,000, corruption..….assumed”
M: Hmm, with a bionic arm, now I know how he jerked himself off to death
[Awkward silence]
JM: “With crime ruling the streets and the police department out of control, there was no other choice but to call the ‘C.O.P.S,’ a ruthless band of county hunters in the…‘Civilian Operated Police S--School--State.’ So it’s an acronym [Silence]
M: Are you--i--is that English?
JM:....”Action superstar David Carradine electrifies the scene as John Tucker, the most powerful and feared of the C.O.P.S. As the leader of the city’s future force he stops at nothing to capture each bounty. But when murder and corruption are exposed within the organization.....uh, Tucker takes the lo--law in his own hands armed with a bionic cannon and a .357 magnum. Tucker’s the city’s only hope for protection from its own band of mercenary killers”
M: Oh my god
JM: And he’s wearing denim! With a bionic ar--
M: Holy crap
[In the screening room]
[David Carradine walks lopsided (?)]
C: Yeah, he’s drunk
J: It’s not gonna be his hemorrhoids, or something [Mike and Colin laugh] “Ow, my ass!”
R: “I’m gonna go back to autoerotic asphyxiation”

[5:54] JM: It’s, uh, it looks action-packed, each time it--each...crime?......Each crime has its price, each...criminal warning bounty dead or alive….[Echoing] Future Force!

[6:24] M: I wonder how good his acting in this is, I sure hope he does a joke [Cuts to a still of Jim] 

[7:24] M: [Turns the tape around] This looks like Patrick Stewart [Points to the guy on the back]
JM: Uh....don’t think so
M:.....I think I’m traumatized...by all these movies. I think I just know what’s gonna happen in. It’s like...minutes leading up to an execution
JM: [Raises the tape, looks at the camera] Future Force! [Mike and Jay burst out laughing] 

[7:55]J: Oh, he’s tryin’
[Silence]
R: Someone has to [Jay and Colin chuckle]
[In the VHS room] 
J: Well, Colin, our final movie tonight is...Geteven [Geteven title card appears] [Jay brings out another tape] Also known as Road to Revenge
C: Why are you pronouncing it like that?
J: [Looks down at the tape].....Because that’s the title. It’s one word, “Geteven”
C: There’s no space in….[Takes the tape, inspects the spine] Oh yeah
J: On the side too, “Geteven”
C: “Geteven,” alright
J: Why don’t you tell us about Geteven, also known as Road to Revenge starring John….De Hart?
C: It wasn’t only starring John De Hart….he wrote it...uh, co-directed it, and he wrote all of the shitty, shitty...love songs in the movie that you’re gonna hear
J: Okay
C: Um, so why don’t I tell you about this?
J: Wait, hold on one second [Looks at the tape in Colin’s hands]
C: He also wrote a novel
J: Is this--
C: It’s on the...it’s on the back!
J: I was just gonna--is this an official release?
C: If this is an official release, as far as I know, I don’t know, but uh, yeah, this is right from the website, this is the official synopsis
J: Ok. There’s lots of, uh, lots of caps
C: Lots of caps, okay. “A fast moving multi-dimensional action romance,” so there’s at least two--
J: This is science fiction film?
C: It--ahh--I don’t know, there’s at least two dimensions, I know that. Uhh, “starring John De Hart--”
R: Not in the acting [Colin and Jay chuckle, camera pans over to Rich standing behind the other camera] 

[10:08] C: “Starring John De Hart, action films veterans Wings Hauser and William Smith. Rick and Huck are two ex-cops betrayed by the machiavellian Normad played by William Smith. Rick and Huck team up to finally end the tyranny of this crooked, dope-dealing, cult-leading judge. [Jay picks up another tape and looks at the back] Rick and his ex-girlfriend Cindy reunite after Rick has left the force. Cindy has had some intriguing visits with drugs, satanic cult followers, and she becomes their target
J: I’m reading along with you
C: Oh! Cool. Uhh, “just after Rick and Cindy wed, the newlyweds are chased with riding a motorcycle by Normad’s thigs in a car,” I think that’s meant to be “thugs” [Jay deflates]
J: Or “things,” maybe
C: Maybe
J: “Normad’s things,” whatever they are
C: Probably, you know, it’s something he summons in the cult, uh, “the resulting crash appears to end the life of Cindy. Rick is devastated by the loss and turns to seeking revenge with the use of crossbows, martial arts, guns, and other weapons. Rick, with the help from Huck, kill Normad and his thug friends, even in the face of U21 firepower”
J: ...What is that?
C: I have no i--
J: Is that a real thing?
C: I--tss--I--I--
J: Is this a U21? [Points to a gun on the cover]
C: I don’t know…..Who knows? That’s not a cross--
J: And why is this woman farting on his head? [Fart sound effect plays]
C: [Chuckling] Why does he look terrified?

[11:56] C: “Combined with a lot of action and camaraderie between Rick, Huck, and Cindy, there’s true romance and thrilling moments with a surprise ending.” I guess the ending’s the only thing they left out in the fucking summary
J: [Chuckles] I was gonna say, I don’t think we need to watch the movie now, I feel like I just have
C: This is just the script--[Jay laughs]--that they just printed on the back of the DVD box [They laugh] Umm--
J: They just had an outline and all of the, uh, dialogue is improvised
C: Yeah
J: Like a Judd Apatow film
C: This was the pitch, so, uh...yeah….[Shows off the tape to the camera] Geteven
J: Wings Hauser….
C: Wings Hauser--
J: For some reason. What is he famous for, Wings Hauser?
C: I have no idea….but I’ve heard he’s really, really, really, really, really drunk in this movie
J: Ok…..Was John De Hart really, really, really, really drunk when he was writing and directing the film?
C: Drunk on power [Silence]
[Jay chuckles, camera pans over again to show Rich] Geteven [Jay laughs loudly] 

[13:24] R: I need a pizza break

[13:38] JM: I didn’t come from Canada for this kind of attitude
M: Oh my god
R: Oh well, they’re gettin’ snippy now
C: That was…
R: They show up a few times and now they think they own the place
M: I thought they were supposed to be polite
R: Oh, we (?) that particular myth

[23:32] R: “I’m gonna take over the world, but on a budget!”

[23:49] M: It’s like little kids, like, pretending the carpet’s lava and jumping around

[24:54] J: Thank you Doctor Eugene Levy

[25:29] R: They’re dressed like something out of, like, a 1990s K-Mart ad
C: Oh yeah, it’s like...least action hero-looking people you’ve ever seen in your life

[26:32] Lady: Hope you had your tetanus shot, bitch!
J: Ssssss
C: Oh god…[Rich covers his face]
M: It doesn’t matter ‘cause she’s dead

[27:16] J: This guy really does suck

[27:37] C: He’s like a character from...he may as well be the lead character in Doom the video game with the kind of damage this guy can take

[28:59] R: Mike, tell us about Future Force 
M: Why do I have to? [Rich throws him the tape] 
R: Yahh!
M: Well, ok...I’ll talk about Future Force, let’s call it--[Long bleep] [Everyone bursts out laughing] Future Force stars…..uh, 60% David Carradine, 40% alcohol

[29:50] M: We’re assuming this takes place in the future or at least a very alternate present? I don’t know, it’s kind of like Robocop....meets Judge Dredd...meets, uh….
R: Dog the Bounty Hunter? [Jay laughs, Mike chuckles]
M: Only with a lot less racism

[31:17] R: Everything in this movie takes too fucking long

[39:19] R: Hey, look, when you die via autoerotic asphyxiation people are gonna be talking about that shit for years to come [Colin laughs] You just have to deal with it
M: It is if you die masturbating, it’s...pretty--pretty embarrassing…
C: Yeah
JM: It’s like everyone caught you

[39:41] [The car is parked in the middle of the parking lot aisles]
JM: Nice parking job 

[41:00] R: The world never got to see a David Carradine, Cameron Mitchell team up
C: Ohhh that’d be so good
R: That would’ve been…
M: Oh my god
R: “Drunken Fury” [Everyone laughs] “Booze and Bullets.” [More laughter] You have one scene where they’re both drunk to do anything, and like, the whole scene is performed via, like--like, like, they got some, like, grips, like, poking them with sticks [Chuckles] They’re being operated like marionettes, with like, Cameron’s just passed out and there’s some kind of intern who’s got, like, strings on his arms so it looks like he’s driving the car
[In Loving Memory 1918-1994 and a picture of Cameron Mitchell appears on screen]
Woman: I guess you think this is all kind of funny, don’t you?
M:.....They’re both dead, though
JM: Yeah, well, the....the horrors of CGI
M: Yeah, we could bring ‘em back--[Rich laughs]--with CGI
C: Would we want to, though?
JM: “Reanimate”
R: I would love to see somebody asking permission before--their families for this [Colin and Rich chuckle] “We want to make a movie with your dead father as an alcoholic cop”
C:....Then you do the CG David Carradine, it’s like--”his eyes are so--they’re so lifeless…..it’s perfect! [Everyone laughs] It’s reaching uncanny valley. It’s exactly like him”

[42:55] C: Geteven is the brainchild of this man right here, it’s John De Hart, uhh, I believe he’s a lawyer, and, uhh, I guess he wanted to make a movie? 
M: [Tugs his shirt collar] A copyright lawyer?

[50:35] R: “Oh, I can feel every wrinkle”

[50:55] Lady: I’ve been fine, how have you been, Vinny?
Vinny: I’m fine...Fantastic
JM: “I’m good, Vinny, I’m dating my father”

[52:18] R: I was half expecting the nun to try and give him a blowjob on the way to the hospital
M: Wha--I’m sorry, what?
R: That was the surprise
M: Surprise, uh...ending?
C: He’s irresistible, like, even to the--
R: Yeah. Even to the nuns he’s irresistible
M: They’ll break their vow of celibacy for--
C: For him
R: For their new God

[53:22] [After revealing the surprise was that the girlfriend was alive all along]
R: “I’m kind of let down, I thought someone was gonna buy me lunch”
C: “I thought I was gonna bang that nun”

[55:55] R: I wish she would jump--dump John De Hart and go back to worshipping Satan
M: He’s a limo--he’s a failed limo driver, who, probably, I don’t know, they’re gonna get bad Yelp reviews after leaving the teens in the desert 

[1:03:15] JM: [Talking about Geteven] I mean, I said it was growing on me as it went on, but now just looking at it, it just makes me feel like I have the flu

[1:03:29] M: Uhh, Rich, I’m sorry to do this to you, but my pick for best of the worst is Parole Violators
R: Hahahahaaa oh fuck
