Rich: Oh! It’s Jim and Colin! From Canada! You’re just in time! I was almost getting the Wheel ready! What? What? Oh. No, not that Wheel. I was talking about the new Wheel! This new Wheel, my final creation, is the ultimate word in non-cinematic video selection. It has a 12 tape capacity, with optional DVD capabilities. Tonight, we are going to watch 3 of these tapes…The first tape, Unauthorized History of Automatic Golf 
Colin:...Automatic golf?
R: Automatic golf, that’s what is says. What is--what is next?
C: Next we have Richie Derwald From Branson to Broadway. Uhh, so Richie there looks like he’s made out of wax and melting
Jim: Covered in barbecue sauce
C: Yeah, he looks like he has that--the buttery glow of a Christmas turkey
JM: He looks delicious
R: He’s red hot
C: He’s red hot, literally
JM: Uh, next we have Tricky People. “Can’t fool me! Safety rules from Yellowdyne” Neh--well--I don’t know what that is
R: Did you turn around to read that?
JM: Uh…
C: Just read it from this side
JM: Oh! That’s a good idea. It’s a new Wheel, I’m not ready for this
R: Followed by Couch Potato Workout with Larry “Bud” Melman
JM: More like Larry “Dead” Melman
R: He’s pro--is he--I’m sure he’s dead
JH: Oh, wow
C: Yeah
R: Yeah
C: Yeah
R: He’s dead
C: Next we have Lights, Camera, Bubbles. “A wild romp through the world of bubbles. Good, clean fun for kids of all ages,” uhh, that guy looks like a pedophile 
JM: Hmm
JM: Hangin’ with Leo. Uhh, Leo DiCaprio: The Unauthorized Documentary. So I guess he didn’t say...I--”you can do this,” and uh...yeah, so, yeah, that’s that
C: I wonder if they’re gonna go into Leo’s Pussy Posse
JM: Uh, well, you never know
R: His what?
C: His Pussy Posse
JM: Toby Maguire, all his friends
R: Oh, was that a thing?
JM: Yeah
C: Back in the, when Leo was, you know, hot...up-and-comer, uh....
JM: This looks like it’s aimed at 12-year olds, so they probably bring up the Pussy Posse
C: Yeah
R: More pedophiles! Next on the Wheel is…
C: Unique Birthday Party Fun and Variety Show! “Professional birthday party entertainment. Guests create their own balloon puppets.” ‘Cause you’re too fucking lazy to make them for your guests, let them do--make their own
JM: Twenty-eight minutes
C: “Use this VHS ‘cassette’ party after party!”
R: That is an amazing cover
C: It’s literally just a picture of a VHS cassette. It literally--
R: For--for birthday parties
C: If they put any less effort into this, it would just be a black box
R: Oh my god And--and now here we have a returning, uh, favorite from, I believe, it was on the Wheel on the very first episode…
C: Oh my god
R: Didn’t watch it….Magic Star Traveler [Jim nods] Which looks part kid show and part New Age garbage, ‘cause they’re in some kind of….geometric shape
JM: Part--part David Chapman [Points to the man on the cover] 
[A chalkboard and chalk lettering appear]
A Little Help….For Millennials: Mark David Chapman shot and killed John Lennon in December of 1980
[Next slide] John Lennon was one of The Beatles. The Beatles were a very popular band. Their influence in music can still be heard today!
JM: Uh, next up is The Golden Road: Today’s Senior Drivers. Uhh, features, uh, tips to become a safer driver, advice for families and friends, uh, detailed warning signs
R: Detailed warning signs, you see--see--uh--yeah--old (?) in a car
C: (?)
JM: Produced in association with the California Highway Patrol, so it’s gotta be good
C: Like CHIPS? [CHIPS rotten tomato score appears] 
JM: Yes…[The Wheel turns]
R: Telepathic Communication with Animals! With Penelope Smith
C: I know--I hope we land on this one...
JM: Yeah, that’d be great
C: ...to learn
JM: [Points to the animals on the cover] I wonder if it’s just those three animals, though 
C: [Chuckles] Just a dolphin--a dolphin, a wolf, and a--
R: Just a trio? Do they fight crime?
C: Aw, that would be great [Silence, Rich and Colin turn the Wheel] Uh, next up is Your Cat Wants a Massage! Uhh...that cat looks like he wants a little bit more than a massage. Uh, “your whiskers to tail guide to cat massage.” Hmm
R: ….Another member of the Pussy Posse [Cat meows] Then finally, we have…!
JM: Uh, this is Mr. Wiggles Sessions King Tut Style. I can read that ‘cause I know gangsta graffiti [Colin laughs] Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to...know how to read that. Uh, this is, the cover is actually by...Mr. Wiggles, uh, Graphics Fix. Sorry, “Graph fix”
C: “Graph fix”
R: So he’s…
JM: “Graph fix”
R: He’s got a--he’s Mr. Wiggles and he also does tape graphics
C: Got a side business doing, uh, the graphic design for his own video tapes
R: All right
JM: And I think he had his arms broken and fixed that way so he could look cooler?
R: Oh my god, that man has two elbows
C: No, it’s the Cobra. He’s doing the Cobra
JM: Looks more like a duck
C: No, it’s like--[Copies what the man on the tape is doing] 
R: He’s got--he’s got two elbow bumps
JM: Hmm
C: Oh yeah
JM: Well this is volume one, let’s hope there’s volume two
C: Maybe that’s why they call him Mr. Wiggles, ‘cause his hand is….
R: [Throws his limp arm about] (?) Alright, who, who wants to give the new Wheel its first spin?
C: [Rubs hands together] Oh my go-o-o-o-d what a great honour
R: Alright
C: I’m just assuming that it’s me
R: I--I--you--you just--you just--you just stepped all over Jim’s moment
C: Sorry, Jim
R: And now you’re gonna spin the Wheel, that’s fine
JM: We discussed before--
C: Hey!
JM:--that I was gonna spin it first, but, no, go ahead
C: Let’s do this together
JM: Oh my goodness [They both grab the Wheel]
C: Ready?
Both: One, two, three [They try to spin in opposite directions, Rich laughs]
JM: Clockwise?
C: Clockwise! [Rich cackles]
[Chalkboard appears again]
A Little Help...For Millennials: “Clockwise refers to the direction the hands move on the face of a clock. A “Clock” is that weird thing that you don’t know how to read so you just look at your phone.
Both: One, two, three! [They spin the Wheel] 
[Colin and Jim clap]
C: Richie Derwald! Richie Derwald! [Lands on The Golden Road, they all cheer and laugh]
R: Golden Road, here we come!

[7:51] R: [To Mike] All she did was say their bones become less brittle and you started laughing [Jay laughs] She didn’t….
Mike: I just picture, like, an old lady flying through a windshield

[8:30] R: Well, Mike, that was Golden Sh--uh, uh, Road! Golden Road!
M: Were you about to say “golden shower”?.....Do you watch videos like that in your private time? [Silence] You know what a golden shower is, right?
R: What’s the next w--w--tape we’re gonna watch? In the w--in--on the Wheel?
M: I don’t know. It’s undetermined yet until we spin the Wheel
R: So--so (?)
M: Oh, you want me to spin it?
R: Yeah
M: Heeeere weee go! I’m gonna do like The Price is Right [Spins the Wheel] 
R: I thought you were gonna manually spin it till you found the tape you wanted [They wait for the Wheel to stop spinning]
M: Oh no! [Lands on Hangin’ with Leo]
Rich and Mike: Nooooooo!!!!!
M: It finally happened!
R: ...Who put this on there?
M: It’s Jay
R: Fuck this--it was Jay?....Goddammit, Jay…..goddammit [Silence, Rich stares at the camera] Fuck this [Walks away] 
M: Come on, everybody!

[10:35] Man: Leo’s very playful nature is instantly infectious with his co-stars  
C: “So is his herpes”

[10:50] J: Rich, has anybody complimented you yet on your fine craftsmanship of the new Wheel?
R: Not on camera, no
J: Ok, well I would like to comment that this is a wonderful job, and it would be a shame if anything ever happens to it. But I’m sure that will never happen
R: You know--you know, I made it flat for a reason?....Can’t…[Touches the side of the Wheel]...since it’s flat, you can’t knock it over, quite…
J: Oh, I’m sure there’s still plenty of things that could be done to this Wheel, but I can guarantee that they will not ever happen
R: Well, let’s hope we land on a good one, Jay, spin the Wheel! [Jay spins it] Come on, Telepathic Communication with Animals! Come on! Slow down! Almost! Come on! YES!
J: Telepathic--
R: YES! YES!
J:--with Animals
R: Woooo!
M: Fuck yeah!
R: Woooo!!!

[13:05] M: These people look like they belong in the bar scene from Galaxy Invader
C: Ohh--
J: Ohhh, yeah! Yeah, it’s weird, the whole thing is like, in the woods…
C: Yeah
J: These all look like desperate weirdos
JM: Yeah. It’s like a Star Wars fan film
(...)
R: Have, like, a dog play the wookie

[13:46] M: Uh, well...here we are again. This nightmare never ends

[14:10] M: [Talking about the first movie] Um, The Golden Rod [Jim starts laughing, an arrow and “got the Star Wars reference” appear] The Golden Road...uh, “one of the best gifts you will ever give a loved one, a friend, a neighbor, or yourself”
R: We’ve already given the internet all of the best gifs 

[15:15] Man: Loved ones must also be on the lookout for warning signs [Shows various dents in cars]
R: [Laughs] Oh no
M: Oh, oh, there’s blood!
R: This is the warning signs the family are noticing, the dents...in your mother’s car
J: Warning signs: there’s a small child on your grill

[16:09] M: So many elderly people are plowing through crowds, they’re...ISIS is starting to recruit elderly people

[17:46] JM: There were scenes of aerobics
M: Oh, yeah yeah yeah
C: That’s right
M: Yep
JM: A mansion that looked exactly like the mansion in Eyes Wide Shut [Colin chuckles] And there, they--
R: Which is ironic ‘cause the elderly can’t see the road at night [Colin laughs]
JM: And they keep cutting back to it and back to it again, uh…
M: Eyes Wide Shut is about napping 

[18:59] C: [Reads the back of the tape] “Does your parent’s car have new dents or nicks?” This is, like, speaking to the, the kids or the younger family members 
M: A child shoe...perhaps? [Colin laughs]
C: A f--
M: In the grill?
C: A finger lodged in the front
M: [Chuckles] Have they pledged allegiance to ISIS? 

[21:06] M: Well, they did hire Robert Stack to do the narration, which--which made it very ominous to begin with
[Chalkboard appears again]
A Little Help...For Millennials: Robert Stack is an actor that hosted a show called “Unsolved Mysteries” from 1987 - 2002. An “Unsolved Mystery” is a mystery that has not yet been solved!

[23:23] M: I thought you were gonna bring up the map of the US when they’re like--
JM: Oh yeah
M: They’re like “these states require extra testing after age 80,” but then they’re like “the most accidents occur in these states” and it’s every state--
C: Which is like every other state
R: Florida--that’ll never happen in Florida because those elderly down there can vote. [In an elderly person voice] “We’re gonna strike down this law that makes it safer on the roads! Just because I have Alzheimer’s and I don’t know the difference between a...a car and a boat doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be able to drive down the river!”

[25:33] JM: Smash cut to, uh, roast beef on special.40-50 percent off
R: (?) roast beef smell bad, it depends

[29:09] R: It’s like “Leo’s cool and collected, he knows what he’s doing, he’s savin’ up his money,” and then like, a minute later somebody say, “well you know, he’s kind of stressed out lately, and, you know, the fame might be getting to ‘im! Leo--Leo, he’s--he’s not ready to settle down, he’s, you know, he’s--all-all the different women…” [In a deep voice] “He could surprise us at any moment and find the one!” [Mike laughs silently]
C: These people make--keep cutting back to these celebrity experts who are ce--
M: [To Rich] Did you make this?
C:--lebrity journalists [Rich laughs]
M: Did you? Did you?
R: I--I--I understand the sleaze behind it, Mike...that these people who are just--are making up shit...so they can sell a video to horny teen girls
M: Don’t be cynical now
JM: Yeah, they’re not necessarily horny, they actually might just really have a crush on him. I mean, why does a teenage girl have to be horny? Like she could just be like “he’s so cute and one day I’d like to marry him and….” [Looks at the others, then downward and sighs]
R: Tha--tha--that saddens you?
JM: No! I just--I just think there is room for...uh, having a crush on someone and liking a celebrity without sex. All the time, sex
C: Jim, do you have...do you have a crush on Leo DiCaprio? [Jim blows into his bottle] 

[33:14] R: Why did we put this on the Wheel?.....Why? Why?

[33:19] M: Let’s talk about the tape itself…..

[36:49] R: Uh--or--okay, Mike…
M: Yeah
R: You believe in ghosts--[Colin laughs]--do you also believe in this crazy thing? Too...
C: [Laughing] You do…[Rich giggles, Colin laughs harder]
M: I find the paranormal fascinating, that--that doesn’t mean I believe in ghosts...no! This video is--is crackpot central, it is--it is--it is weird, lonely ladies...cat ladies, uh, in somewhere in, probably California on--on weird farms, possibly hippie communes
C: Possibly the same one!
M: Maybe the same one, w….weirdos who think that this weird lady can talk to their animals for them and...these people are nutso…….On that note, I’d like to talk to you about my belief in ghosts

[38:03] [Woman says she felt something calling her and found a dried-up puddle with goldfish still barely alive]
C: That’s not true
JM: No
C: How could the puddle dry up fast enough that the goldfish are still alive by the time she….
M: You’re questioning that over the fact that the goldfish telepathically asked for help?

[38:54] [After the narrator says Penelope does phone readings, Mike turns to Jay and Rich]
M: Do you think this is bullshit?

[38:58] JM: This is copyright 1990, but clearly she goes through...uh...transformations throughout--
C: Like four--
JM: Where she looks completely uh, unfamiliar and…
C: There was a point we didn’t know if it was the same person
JM: Right
R: Maybe that’s the cost of using her psychic power, every time she tries to talk to a dog, she ages in dog years [Colin laughs]
JM: Well apparently it--[(?)]
C: Like...becomes the dog, because it was saying, you know, you think like the animal and talk, and, like…
M: She lost ten years of her physical self...to tell this lady that this dog...needed a treat [Dog barks]
R: [Laughs; In a womanly voice] “He so--he likes food…” [Mike screeches] (?) “He’s very happy to be with you, but he would like more treats” (?) “I can tell you how your cat feels but I’ll get arthritis”
M: “Please tell me……(?) he doesn’t like the placement of his litter box (?) At the end of The Last Crusade
R: That’ll happen if she tries to do, like, an elephant
M: Yeah [Everyone laughs] And then--[Jim makes an elephant trumpeting sound]--when the dust clears--
C: It would just be like a swastika--
M: I was gonna say that, the dust flies away and you still see the swastika. “Why was that there? I--I--” [Shrugs]
C: “I heard she was a Nazi” 
M: I guess she was…..[Rich laughs]
JM: Uh--
M: Hitler was learning how to talk to animals…
R: He was gonna use...rhinos to conquer England
M: Spider monkeys
C: What if she got, like, telepathic abilities because her mother was involved in, like, Nazi experiments in, like, World War 2?
M: “Let me tell you how--”
R: She’s the end result of one of those Nazi experiments
C: Yeah! She got, like--
R: To train an army of rhinos…
C: “People create!”
R:...to fight the Third Reich!
C: “An army of people who can speak to animals!”
R: That’s why Stalin had to--to counter that with his hybrid ape human program
M: Ohhhh
C: What? Was that real?
R: That’s a--that’s a real thing
C: Wha-a-a-a-t!
R: Supposedly…
C: That’s crazy
R: It’s--it’s a real thing I heard, I don’t know if it’s actually true, but I’ve heard...that Stalin tried...to...force...a human--[Mike spits his drink out, everyone laughs] ...to mate with a gorilla!
C: Oh no
R: So he could have…so…so...[Laughs]
M: Can somebody get me a paper towel?

[41:25] J: This woman looks like Lion-O from Thundercats

[46:04] JM: There was a bit of bullshit going on there, which leads me back to my…
C: You think so?
M: Oh! The video ha--i--is bullshit? [Jim snorts]
C: What? That’s where they lost me, when they said the dog went to another--I was buying it up to that point and she can talk to fucking gophers and horses

[46:30] JM: “These spider monkeys helped me get through my 3 divorces”

[47:40] JM: How much of this telepathy is lost in translation where it’s like a broken telephone?
R: Well, none of it, because there’s no actual communication going on
C: Or...are dogs liars?
M: That’s also true
R: It just wanted to eat that fucking chicken
M: He’s like “yeah, ooh yeah...I’m a murderous crazy dog, I wanna eat chickens. I’ll tell this bitch anything to get her out of here. Keep me from eating chickens.” The animals are smarter than her
(...)
M: “ (?) want a...cracker graph?” [Rich makes a confused expression] “Test for a parrot? [Parrot squawks] [Mike squawks, Rich laughs] “Do you….do you not want a cracker?” [Squawks]
R: Mike...Mike, that is so dumb it’s funny

[50:05] R: Where was she when the whole Harambe thing was going on? [Colin chuckles] Penelope Smith...zoo hostage negotiator

[50:46] R: You know what they need to do? You know that--that gorilla that knows sign language?
C: Koko
R: They need to have...they need to have Koko explain that Penelope is full of shit when Penelope is completely wrong about what Koko is thinking
JM: That’d be amazing
R: It could be like a setup, you know, “Penelope, we need to tell you, we need you to tell us what this gorilla’s thinking,” she’ll do a full reading, “what we didn’t tell you is that this gorilla knows sign language! Koko! Is what she said accurate?” [Puffs out his cheeks and shakes his head] 
(...)
M: “Koko, is she a fraud?”

[52:03] [A rooster crows over Rich’s laugh] 

[55:33] M: Three of us picked it and, and you didn’t, and whic--which I--I think is a little weird [Silence]
R: I don’t know what you want from me right now. I don’t….What am I supposed to do? Get upset that my tape didn’t win? In this stupid--show, that--that the voting doesn’t matter? Am I supposed to--”oh! Oh, that Golden Road! It should’ve wo-o-o-o-n!”
[Silence]
M: Well….how do we destroy the Leonardo DiCaprio tape? [Nobody responds] Should we just try to find him and throw it at him? [Colin laughs] 
R: Needs to get ripped apart by, like, fangirls. Fangirl groupies
M: Maybe we could take the tape to a gym?
C: Send it to the beach and then film it through a hole cut in, like, a changing room tent
M:....Make the tape have sex with a supermodel?
JM: Throw it into a bear den--[Rich smashes the tape on the table]--oh--or that
M: Do it! Do it! Just do it! Just do it! [A reel flies and hits Jim] [Mike continues yelling]
R: [Looks at the destroyed tape] Thundercats? This is the wrong tape!
