oh yeah well you know this is cdc
regulations you know i
don't know why we all were for a little
bit i don't know why this was going
gonna help me not get covered
but i wanted to do my part it's strange
that it came down to just you having to
wear that
well rich i thought since it's episode
101 of best of the worst today and uh
we'd celebrate by you know not having to
wear the mask anymore
we just watched some fucking movies so
101
back to basics i don't even thought of
that
it's because you're not clever it's true
i'm pretty dumb
then again i was wearing an ape mask for
a year and a half oh yeah
hey speaking of ape why don't you tell
us about our first movie
well yes i would love to tell you about
defy the jaws of
giant shark oh no destroy a teeming city
demolish an ocean liner and vanquish
monster reptile newly
remastered in 3d and hd
oh god a freighter peacefully glides the
still waters of a soft pacific night
their cargo a recently captured
36 foot ape
a giant fist comes up to the deck
sending the sailors sprawling
and in a matter of seconds the a-p-e
oh this is glorious oh this is glorious
it's an
it's an acronym oh yes yes it should be
with the asters
do you want to know what ape stands for
desperately
attacking primate monster
i see what kind of movie we're in for
okay all right
is loose after battling a very large
snake
a very a very large snake it's ver the
steak is
very large quite big
it's a it's a vlsk
and a giant white shark
defies the jaws of the great white
and is the victor so that's been spoiled
oh we know who wins the shark fight
well i mean he's the main character
after all american
actress joanna kearns oh she is
certainly tv's growing pains oh
um oh looks like we're about to be the
center of a new revival
arrives in south korea to appear in a
film at the same time
has also arrived and lays
waste the city of icon
and continues his march forward
destroying everything in his path
paul leader i dismember mama oh
co-wrote and directed this cult classic
that needs to be
seen to be believed you mean this
well that's that's a happy coincidence
hey
weird and which co-stars hollywood
veteran
alex nichol the man from laramie
the screaming skull i can't wait
easy now action okay
let's go watch
he's lucky all these buildings are made
out of styrofoam
styrofoam and fire
he happened to break into the fire
factory maybe that's he's lucky there's
a gigantic human nearby with a fire
extinguisher
hey listen why don't you tell your
bosses that you're exhausted after 17
and a half hours on a plane
and you've desperately got to go to bed
and you've got just the guy to tuck yet
where's the ape
why isn't everybody talking about the a
yeah that seems like it'd be pretty big
news you think literally everyone would
be talking about the fucking ape
like yeah there's an american actress
that came to the country but has she
heard about the ape
and what happened in a remote fishing
village which and this is before the internet
it's a giant ape
that news travels fast
korea's not that big of a country
i got next
oh sorry
oh oh
i like how they didn't hear the destruction from next door
yeah
they're still eating their dinner
that fucking pool all over there
they're always so loud
it's pretty loud at the wall usually
they get pretty rowdy
wow josh that was ape
yes it was
oh oh oh oh sorry uh uh
frank stallone
easy kill
frank stallone barfly gives an explosive performance
close quotes non-stop action suspense
story of today's brutal drug wars
okay sounds good sounds good
jake anderson is in deep trouble
her husband alex is a diplomat turned bad
he's been using his diplomatic immunity to smuggle cocaine out of peru
oh no
ex-cop frank davies frank stallone was getting along just fine until jake came into his life
now he finds himself coming to the
rescue of this beautiful rich mystery
woman
what frank doesn't know won't hurt him
or so jake thinks
but frank knows a lot more than he's
letting on he knows about the secret
bomb
he knows about the illegal yeah
i guess he knows about the illegal money
and he knows not to quit until all drug
enemies are eliminated
this sounds like an 80s action movie
only by eliminating all drug enemies can
we achieve world peace
explosive action and suspense fill the
screen as the drug war rages on
93 minutes color okay fan [ __ ] tastic
now now horses in this oh um
jane badler
okay and uh cameron mitchell
"you're late"
"hey five minutes"
"what's the big deal"
"where you going"
"out"
"must you elaborate all the time"
now now now the last time the last time we had frank malone and cameron mitchell in the movie together we we got "close the fucking doors"
we did
and that was frank stallone what is it
frank malone
it sounds like a name i'm not first
appearance of franklin
is the father of post oh yeah
although when this movie was made he
would have been pre-malone well
it's 1989 it's true
now the last time we had frank stallone and cameron mitchell in a movie together we got "close the fucking doors"
that's true
"alright close the fucking doors"
"will you close the fucking doors"
"close that fucking door"
"assholes"
i i have i have high expectations
and they're going to be shattered when the movie's a terrible letdown
yes
but right now i have high expectations
what we learned from terror in beverly hills is that a movie has to have the right ratio of frank stallone to cameron mitchell
will easy kill do that
let's find out
"do you know these guys no"
"fbi"
"jay what the hell's going on"
"i don't know"
"you don't know or you don't want to tell me"
"let him in i want to find out"
i have good instincts about stuff
"give me the gun alex"
"what for you blew him away"
"how do i know you're not gonna blow me away"
"where's the cash
turn the page when you hear the sound
"take it easy speedo i'll give you the gun"
"relax okay"
"i'll take it easy alex"
this is the story of return of the jedi
i'll show you how
oh assume his identity
she's trying to swap her husband with frank stallone because why not
that's why that's why the bomb they're faking the husband
wait look at that
go back i can't wait
she never thought to mention hey you look exactly like my husband
i think rich might be right
they're trying to fake the husband's death
no
that he he has a split personality
yeah
no
that's too much for this movie it's like fucking fight club right
no way
we're rapidly heading towards a fork in the road
she's extremely stupid or pretty stupid
yes
yeah
one of the two
i'm not sure
which way we're going to get
no i really don't know
all right rich it's time to wrap it up
here's our last movie of the day
i want you to tell me all about honorable men
honorable men
uh cops on film
"uh a choice between love and honor"
oh you must choose
you must choose
oh
"drug investigator ryan smith (garrett sayer, swat commander in death penalty"
oh
oh him
yeah death penalty
no that's not
that's not there we didn't get lucky that time
"faces the toughest decision of his life"
hello
"a choice between love and honor ryan"
"finds out that the woman he loves, mandy (glenda johnson), is involved withthe same drug dealers that he is busting"
oh my god
"the influence of another woman's love and the cataclysmic climax of a high-risk drug raid brings the movie to a stunning turning point"
boy we're having a druggie day huh
yeah we're very very very cop druggy day
yeah
"casey (leslie linder, fbi files)"
yeah
is that like a tv show 
it's gotta be
it's like forensic files offshoot
wow
that'd be weird
or maybe ripoff
i don't know
"is the sweet daughter of the head of the narcotics division, a beautiful young woman who has crush on ryan"
oh
"can her love pull him away from the confused but alluring mandy"
probably not
"the heart-pumping action of gunfights swat raids and car chases pauses just long enough for a captivating romance set in the middle of this action movie"
oh i bet it does
"about the takedown of a drug kingpin"
how how often, josh, are the people on the covers the same as the people in the movie
this is fair
now this man is not nearly handsome enough to be just like a stock photo guy they pulled up
so this is probably
that's what i'm saying
it's probably the guy
i'm also thinking that overall the feeling of we made this at home on our computer of the whole uh package really lends that to some credence
okay
well let's let's see if this is amazing
all right
as i hope it will be
let's check it out
all right
what the fuck is happening 
did you guys have too much drugs
or too little apes
this is what you've done with your life
this is what you've done with your life
and we're gonna have to be careful on this one this guy's really dangerous
yeah that's what i've heard i'm ready
for him
i'm a cop sorry i can't make it tonight
i'm gonna be with tag team two
i'm gonna take down another crack house
that's okay i'm bulletproof
he looks like clark kent if clark kent
weren't actually superman
i met this guy that i had a crush on as
a little girl remember that cap i told
you about yeah i remember you talking
about it i told him if he needed my
services as a physical therapist he
could stop by hey yo
where are we walking no no let's go
through this parking lot do i live here
but i only see you about twice a month
yeah i remember when i was your field
training officer and you were fresh out
of the neighborhood
i don't know you're older and younger
guys i can control
i can't control you
you're too much man for me cop man
you're a cop and you're a man okay man
if that's where you want it
i changed my mind oh yeah never mind huh
come in at night he don't even
put another scene in between nothing to
break it up
he looks like he's about to get caught
by chris hanson
have a seat that nervous look if he's
not
not sure
mike jay you guys don't have to wear
masks anymore
oh thank god
i know what what a stupid requirement
well [ __ ] we watched some movies yes we
we we had a perfectly
normal standard best of the worst for
our
101 episode this is my very favorite
format
it's almost it's almost a gimmick in and
of itself
that's so rare not having a gimmick yeah
yeah it's kind of sad that's what it
meant and
mike yes you got to tell us about
and i said what is this ape what is this
lot is the same y is the same
i was released it's released by keno
lorber yeah
pretty classy well not really classy
company sometimes classy company
i don't know the the cover the cover
speaks for itself
does it though it's beautiful and we
have vhs we have a vhs version with a
different cover
oh yeah and somebody messed up the year
to 67.
on the dv and the vhs yeah they wrote 67
instead of 76.
someone clearly didn't care um but ape
is the story
of an ape a 36 foot tall ape
look out oh
at one point the ape wrestles the snake
for three seconds
and then throws it away oh no it's the
giant snake
how come nobody was worried about the
giant snake
oh hey um
like that's a really big snake yeah
ugh
wow holy [ __ ] don't hit the camera bill
wait was that the extent of this
fight with the giant snake what are you
gonna do you get to advertise it in the
poster
giant sea the giant snake fight
well he throws it directly at the camera
and they broke the camera and they had
to just stop filming that day
well let's let's start at the beginning
you know 36 feet doesn't doesn't even
sound
that intimidating in the grand scheme of
things like in the 50s we had attack of
the 50-foot tall woman yeah
i like 36 feet i you know what my head i
think
andre the giant could take a 36 foot
tall eight
he probably could he'd go with those
little chicken legs that this ape has
that's true just take him down there is
not an ocean liner which was promised on
the cover of the box and this is a
little lego
there's a it's like a like a uh what do
you call it it's like a schooner
yeah but it's like a like a cargo vessel
or something that's
it's bigger than a schooner but not that
much it's enough to hold a 36 foot tall
ape in its cargo hold
as we find out yes uh and there's a guy
a captain
as a crewman they come on they have a
cigarette one of them is clearly stoned
yes thank you
were you there on island when they
caught him yes sure was
i would have missed it for the world
he's something to see i tell you i know
imagine almost
36 feet tall wow
i'm so stoned he's so [ __ ] stoned
he's barely getting his lines up very
slowly releasing his lines
for the world to hear he's just trying
to remember him
he's remembering him as they come out of
his i'm pretty sure his last line was
not
was not scripted no that last line was
oh
[ __ ] as you said jay we jump to the
point which is the
end of the the skull island part where
they capture kong
of king kong uh king kong we skip all
that yeah if you ever watched king kong
and you said you know what i wish we
didn't have the first two acts this is
the movie for you
i'm comfortable with that especially the
peter jackson one goes on way too
long like let's just nah peter jackson
we spent 45 minutes just showing naomi
watts walk onto the boat look she
touched the railing
oh um but uh so so the
whoever has captured this
big ape and is put in this clip we don't
know we don't know
who when or why they captured this big
game
we don't know the intent the intent is
is like complained about by the captain
or whatever he's like
you know it's it's almost a shame to
put a beast into captivity and then put
him on display for everybody to talk at
it's like oh this this poor ape is going
to be shown around the world he's been
he's been drugged
and they're going to take them to these
different uh destinations the last of
which is disneyland
disneyland you've got to be bullshitting
me
no it's true do they say that they do oh
that's why that's why that's why the
other crew guy is like you gotta be
shooting me
i completely missed that yeah that's it
that's just a bad idea
yeah it's a terrible idea i'm stoned and
i know that yeah
but so it takes him about five seconds
to say that oh he's he's
totally gassed out and he's gonna be
asleep for five more days
immediately
oh [ __ ]
oh no that's beautiful that unrelated
toy boat is in trouble too
oh jeez holy [ __ ]
oh [ __ ] they went for it comedic timing
listen this ape knows about comedic
beats yeah and we'll get more to that as
we go but he really does no we know
oh yeah he is a great dancer
well they've they've been practicing for
show business for when they take them on
twitter yes
yeah they've been teaching them how to
dance oh he was going to be out like out
front of epcot with like
like the bands dancing with mickey mouse
just just voguing it up
this one is it a water bottle that was a
shark fin
believe it or not a water bottle we're
just getting right into it
because it's fighting this shark whether
you like it or not
oh i like it i like it just fine whoa
that is that actually looks like an
actual
escapes from the boat and immediately
wrestles a shark
yes and so we have a 36 foot tall ape
right now i'm talking about scale here
rich
i'm talking about scale the 36 foot tall
ape which is almost
four stories tall versus a shark that
seems about the same
length and even a great white shark
which is a pretty massive shark
this is rivaling the size of the ape uh
but we said
we didn't know what world does this
exist in yeah the world
look at skull island the world of
mountains right could there be large
monsters who knows
i think it could have encountered the
world's last existing megalodon
that's probably possible either way ape
has the advantage because that shark is
already [ __ ] dead
yeah and eventually it tears the shark's
face open and we move on
and you can see where is his arm where
the glove meets the sleeve of the
costume
were you expecting anything better i
guess i didn't know what to expect
yeah we want to talk about the costume
real quick because it's got that
it's got the [ __ ] suburban sasquatch
nipples
real prominent uh it's just covered in
uh
carpet yeah it's just like carpet the
jaw just kind of
moves a little it moves a little lamb it
doesn't seem to be
necessarily correlated with anything
it's not a great costume
no we can all agree on that for the time
and the budget i think it was acceptable
come on guys come on cut it out
oh my god hey let this lock up his ass
ape kills the shark he smashes the
village the next day
kids go to korean disney world oh and
the farmers
and then the first the farmers run away
kids at korean disney world
hang gliders he encounters hang gliding
and he's delighted by them he's very
happy he's like oh this is cute
they're flying around and he's like
clapping yeah they're which is a
setup for the helicopters which are bad
oh my god poor toy meanwhile a a a white
woman has come
to korea to make a movie right and we
have to mention who that is
that's that's joanna kearns from from
growing pains the mother mom
for the mom from growing pains and got
the character's name wrong
you mistake the mom from growing pains
from the mom from growing pains from the
mom from family i'm so [ __ ] up
totally lost
everybody does family family ties and
growing pains those two shows are just
i'm just sure for the longest time the
entire cast of
uh growing pains had a big laugh about
how joanna kearns was involved with the
most
embarrassing thing that anyone that show
had ever done oh that's right but then
luckily kirk cameron
made saving christmas
and then kirk cameron had a birthday
party
oh yeah the famous birthday party fun so
you're confusing joanna kearns
with meredith baxter bernie the mom
from family time more like i just those
two shows those two shows mix and merge
titles yeah it's called the 80s blur
yeah completely understood i often
confuse mr belvedere for elf
but alf was actually uh physically
incapable of sitting on his own balls
they're both obnoxious creatures that
move in with a family and won't stop
eating
but only one of them admits to eating
cats
i was going to say one eight and one
stayed far away from me
i like a little something sweet every
now and then but i just stop
anytime all right so joanna kearns shows
up
she's got a boyfriend's she's making
like a rape movie
yeah the only the only thing we know
about this come on
come on it's one scene in the whole
thing it's two scenes you don't know the
context there are two races
literally every scene we see them
filming for this this movie
is joanna kearns getting raped yeah
that's true
you [ __ ]
one more time one more time you
[ __ ]
you've gotta take a decent
this is a goddamn rape scene and you
want me to be gentle dino
don't you know how rape works
[ __ ]
it's true and so she's running away
screaming for help and
ape wants to be helpful he's like oh no
this woman's in trouble
goes and picks her up so eventually ape
picks up joanna kearns
and goes around there for a while and
puts her in a cave and luckily
her man friend shows up and goes to save
her because otherwise she wouldn't
understand that she could just leave
oh
yeah he's voking it up that's her what
if that woman was smart enough
to run away herself
no one else no one quite gave that that
a thought
she's not in the cave she used her own
brain to realize
the military was causing a distraction
and she could get away herself
mike a woman wouldn't think to do that
please
not in the 70s the big thing throughout
like the last part of the movie is
they're trying to take ape alive
but that order must be changed sir
there's not a chance in hell
for some reason under the direction of
who knows what do they want
they want him alive alive
alive yeah we should note that we keep
cutting away to the u.s army
yeah and this uh captain or whatever
he's drunk is the main point now what
kind of
[ __ ] you trying to hand me and he
really doesn't want to be on the phone
but he has to be on the phone all the
time
multiple phones uh excuse me just one
second captain
colonel davis here right right keep
right on after him
give me the goddamn operation center
he's got a couple phones going on he's
got an assistant who doesn't want to be
there
i need you to sign it sir not now can't
you see i'm busy
what the hell are you looking at my fly
unzipped or something
yeah i was looking and he just basically
will pick up the phone and say what
hello hello oh hello hello
yeah what what
what oh
yeah pick up the other phone
but oh right and he doesn't we don't
ever see the other side of those
conversations
after seed after scene
in the don dollar set yeah right
he's extremely incompetent in in
militaristic terms
he has no power in terms of like i mean
oh gosh if if
the north koreans decided to invade this
guy would find out about
seven hours later yeah why you gotta be
kidding
me someone would call he would disregard
all reports
as drunken farmers
there's a giant 36 foot tall ape walking
around smashing buildings and then you
spend two hours on the phone
just confused about what's happening
you're ignoring his brilliant tactics at
the end of the film which was
go to where the ape is and shoot at the
gates yes and
you have the right idea in the long run
sir the apes leaving soul he's heading
back to the mountains good that's where
we'll get him
at one point the decision was made to
not capture the ape
and just go ahead and kill it yeah who
made that decision
no idea it was not the south korean
general mr mr kim i think was the name
and then or it wasn't the us commander
some someone
high not high above made the decision
now we're just going to kill him anyway
the space force could be space force
their way up there i don't know
the person we never see on the other end
of the phone president nixon himself
killed the ape
can we drop the open the vietnam war
sure the vietnam war is over it's korean
army headquarters on the line colonel
what the hell do they want to talk to me
for but it's about the eight
i'm pretty sure not the issue why the
[ __ ] does everyone want to talk to me
about that ape
but so while everybody well initially
they don't want to kill the a but they
are attacking him and there are
um you know the thing shots being thrown
at him and then
helicopters coming at him and he's he's
dancing them away
and then uh joanna kearns gets taken to
seoul
and for some reason ape decides to make
his way down that way because he's
looking for his lady friend
um because that's what king kong does
and he's seen the movie so he knows that
he's only got so many beats left to hit
just watch the movie yeah but joanna
kearns we should we forgot one character
her boyfriend
i forgot a porter guy he's a reporter he
wants to marry her
she's a little iffy on the marriage
thing because he's such a joke they keep
making out
and then yeah he's the one who says i'm
going to take you to seoul
and hide you there well mr kim says go
to my house
yeah he takes him to his wife's house mr
kim help my wife play with a marionette
from my
children for a long time well you
uncomfortably look around as an ape
smashes
buildings yeah people are really slow
to respond to the attacks of the ape
until finally ape smashes through the
right building
the ape found me i don't know how but he
found me all right you're
oh goodness run into this tiny set i'm
going to talk
about there
my comes it finally happened
oh yes look at all that debris that's
great
the house is apparently made out of
paper yeah there's a little balsa wood
in there
like newspapers flying
that's another sequence someone
mentioned while we were watching it that
the movie almost feels like zucker
brother-esque was that you rich
i thought i thought it would be good if
you turned it into a zucker's
comedy you go all in on that so much of
it feels like like
that like a spoof movie where they just
cut out the jokes it sits right on that
the execution of it feels it's like uh
like attack of the killer tomatoes like
it feels
comical
i'm on the phone again this guy is
is he left he hasn't left his mouth no
you need the the drunken general on the
phone to be playing up the drunkenness
yeah and every now and then getting off
the phone and saying i picked the wrong
day to stop sniffing glue
we are talking about a movie where the
ape flips off the military
dancing his ass off yay
i wasn't expecting that
was that just the guy in the aid costume
like he was sick of doing the dancing so
he just did that to the director that
sounds better
yeah that's the one like uh obviously
intentionally funny moment
that's the the one joke they forgot to
edit out yeah to make it a real movie
that's the path this movie could have
gone down and we would have loved it
occasionally the camera like pulls back
and you see that it's miniatures
yeah well a lot of times when ape is
stumbling around a smaller village of
miniatures
he doesn't really seem like he's trying
to smash the buildings
it just seems like an accident which is
like oh oh [ __ ] i oh oh i stepped on
that i'm really sorry
it's like yeah it's very very much there
were three distinct directions for the
ape
direction one was you're mad direction
two is you're confused
direction three is you're looking for
joanna kearns
well direction four is just dance and
the direction for it was just
hey now it's time to dance buddy
so at the end um what happens
uh they they kill tanks oh they say hey
instead of trying to capture alive let's
kill it and then they kill him and then
they shoot him with the u.s general
finally leaves his office that was the
most shocking thing in the movies
another location yeah they just filmed
that on like his way out to the car he
wasn't in the same woods everyone else
is in
that's true he was held to the airport
after his after his
after his main thing was done he was
heading to the airport and just like
pull over
we're going to do a couple more shots
you turn that camera around you can see
the parking lot where his car is parked
i was heading to the liquor store
mike the duty-free in the airport hey
whatever you could pack in your carry-on
duty-free that's right
as an audience we are left in the
position
of of uncomfortableness is the actor
drunk
order the third and fourth battalion to
reinforce the korean perimeter around
seoul
what what
do you believe in the ape yet swatner
helicopters
oh that's just a belgian
too much to drink no no it's the
military i asked you
telling pilots to stop drinking
only i can drink the ape knows what the
middle finger gesture means
this is [ __ ] or is he playing drunk
or he's playing drunk but he's not
because there's no alcohol around he's
not like
you know bobby my assistant ever since
the korean war ended i've been stuck
here for 20 years right
one day 1958 something like that right
he could have like a painful backstory
and my wife left me during the war
i've been post here and all i do is
drink bourbon
the loch ness monster couldn't make it
over the berlin wall
i wish there was something crazy would
happen like a giant ape would emerge
from the ocean
and say wreak havoc on the town you're
putting some great drama into this movie
right you know and you know what like i
fought in wwii
right i i was a young soldier i got the
the medal of honor
and now after the korean war i'm pushing
pushing pencils we crashed into the
jungle and my entire squad was
was wiped out by apes oh yeah there you
go yes
i hate apes i hate them
how about this he fought in iwo jima
right and he
they were being very quiet and they
a a local chimpanzee
and then and all the japanese whole
squad killed and they got his whole
squad killed
and i've never trusted a monkey since
but the problem is the end of that arc
is that he learns to trust a monkey and
we couldn't have that
and that that would be the ultimate arc
yeah is that he realizes the ape is good
yeah and he says stop the firing stop
the firing this war
it's it's out of control this ape is
good we just need to take him back to
wherever he came from
we don't know but then the military says
no and he says i'm done with the
military
you have a whole story around the
general sure so ape dies
yeah ape gets shot the [ __ ] up
you found what's up legs
that's good he's speaking of blood we're
making progress
and i guess like as far as the
characters go the arc is
joanna kearns wasn't sure if she wanted
to marry
a guy because he was a jokester
but then the ape died so she said okay
we can get married
so is this movie a growing pains prequel
yes was that ellen thicke's character
oh interesting when they did the sitcom
they just
recast
she shaved himself off he learned
psychology
lost some blade knows he knows about
music and dancing
oh yeah he wrote the theme to [ __ ]
the facts of life
take the good you take the bad you take
the ape and there you got the fat slime
uh well can we talk about the arc give
me that ape
again
oh my god kirk cameron's gone off the
rails again
kirk cameron doesn't believe in
evolution we can't have an a show
we've gotta fire the ape we gotta fire
them
the ape is in playboy
kirk cameron doesn't want him on set
uh show me a smile again
well burn that god
the really sad part is there is no
quality
narrative no there's no there's no
there's no narrative arc whatsoever
no it's just an ape shows up and wreaks
havoc and then
it's terrible yes oh that was really
great actors really great but you're
gonna have to do it again
all right uh rich why don't you tell me
about easy kill here's the ultra quick
synopsis of easy kill it's like alex
kurtzman wrote a noir thriller
with only three and a half characters
frank stallone without a pre-established
franchise to ruin
unless this takes place in the terror
from beverly hills universe
it does share some it shares some actors
there's a potential there
there's an old there's an old factory
there's frank stallone there's cameron
mitchell those are the three ingredients
you need for tearing beverly hills but
listen all doors stay open as far as i
know
i'm sending a courier with the money a
guy called martin you met him once
before
the old factory in south street factory
old factory it's the same location
cameron mitchell old factory this is a
plan it's in frank stallone's contract
close the [ __ ] door
we know it's your cameraman holy [ __ ]
only you want the door closed
unlike tara and beverly hills though
this movie has frank stallone in the
lead and he's in the whole movie
he showed up the whole time frank
stallone has retired and he bought a bar
along with his friend cameron retired
from being a cop retired from being a
cop
so he owns a bar now one night and the
only other employee is cameron mitchell
the only employee is cameron mitchell
i'm assuming cameron mitchell gets paid
in booze
i think they want the film at the bar
and cameron mitchell just happened to be
there
and they're like hey cameron you want to
be on our film and he was like oh
there's a box
give me 20 bucks i'm here every night
when you shoot here every day
i'm not supposed to go behind the bar
anymore but if
per state
oh
that's a different role for him
no they couldn't stop just going right
he's in another scene later it's a
different game this is not his role
he's just there well you got him
on me so one night a femme fatale
walks into the barn and she looks
distressed
so our hero frank stallone you know
asked what's what's bothering you he has
no choice because he is a good
man sure so he has to bother women at
his bar
you all right yes yes i'm fine
can i get you a cup of coffee no thank
you
is everybody [ __ ] talking to me
bye and and our femme fatale says
i'm okay leave me alone [ __ ] off frank
stallone
that should be the title of the movie
stop sniffing my shoes like stallone
so then to get away from frank stallone
our femme fatale immediately
leaves the bar so frank stallone being a
very concerned heroic man
walks outside of this bar to harass her
and says
hey lady what's bothering you
hey hey lady you left
something she's trying to get away from
you sir
you went into a bar and you had a drink
and then you left the bar hey
what's up with that and she keeps
walking down the block
and then frank stallone shows up with
his car and he's like hey lady
get in my [ __ ] car is bothering you
get in my [ __ ] car
he will not take nothing where do you
live where do you
live and feeling very threatened she
tells him where she lives
come on glad give me a break will you
doing your favor believe me
where to
81 albion drive and then they drive a
block
and then she jumps out of the car and
runs away
hey hey where you going hey hey oh
get back in my car stranger who doesn't
want to do anything with me
because she realizes the mistakes she's
made as frank stallone
being our hero and very concerned drives
to her house uninvited
he makes sure she's okay because he's a
very nice heroic man
he's very concerned and then he comes
back the next day you know
just to keep checking in on her
uninvited he doesn't leave he stays the
night because she wants him to sleep
over there
and then he and then he showers he
shaves in the morning and then he leaves
and goes to the
bar and and then frank sloan starts
wearing
her husband's clothing
i just remembered i don't know you i
need to get some sleep
would you like to join me in my bed
while i sleep
you could smell more of my shoes you're
implying she would ask him before he
just
joined her in her bed
this is gonna be standing there in the
doorway she's gonna walk in
i'm gonna take a shower
also maybe have a dump
then i'm going to make some long
distance phone calls
where do you keep your other shoes
listen you have a place where i can uh
clean up yes
the jokes are real
this is ready for the 15-minute scene
with him just taking the crab
that's what's next frank you dump before
the shower
i think they have to you're wearing your
bathrobe
you like it then then frank salone
finally finally goes home for a night
and then when he comes back the next day
our femme fatale has slit her own wrist
presumably because she just wants to get
away from frank stallone
call an ambulance bro
huh frank stone doesn't need an
ambulance
he'll take care of this himself
you're right put him in bed good night
just don't even take her to the hospital
he knows he doesn't need it
your body will make five quarts of blood
by tomorrow morning i'll be fine what
what yeah i i'm distracted you
he just bandages up her wrist himself
and doesn't call a doctor
what's your stretch straight to that
nobody is allowed to take care of this
woman's problems but
frank stallone hold on you just said
frank stallone
more times than any casting agent in
hollywood history he said ranks alone
more
times than sylvester's ever said it or
art jackie
oh it's a scene from gremlins
the belter juicer
just make yourself at home frank
i thought he was just like brushing his
face he just got out of control
brushing his teeth
he's using the peltzer bathroom buddy
oh got him there this is quick swim in
the face
shaving cream oop
drugstore peltzer products in this house
let's see where's her tampons he's going
to start
sniffing those
is it a coincidence because the premise
revolves around the fact that frank
stallone looks identical
to her husband who is a diplomat
slash cocaine drug lord now this is true
but we don't necessarily know that
information until a solid hour 15 into
the movie
yeah yeah this is a revelation later in
the film because
that revelation makes you question the
entire concept of the film yeah right
leading up to
when we're introduced to this this
character that we we eventually find out
as her husband
uh it definitely sounds like an
off-screen narrator
2ks and a gram too generous huh
well let's try it and see it's pure
peru the pause going to that airport was
tough
so you have dogs sniffing up and down oh
yeah she's married to
like a like a trailer voice over guy
thank you for having the cocaine please
give me the cocaine we are going to make
a drug deal now mr hermann
exactly let's do the deal and get out of
here
baby could we do more than just talk we
get nasty
nasty i'm told you're good you'll be
carrying it in this
i was looking so good i couldn't reject
myself i had to touch myself
coming out of my shirt and then the
skirt came down oh my
take it easy speedo i'll give you the
gun relax
okay but the point being the entire
premise of the movie is that the wife is
setting up frank stallone the only way
that could work is if she finds somebody
that looks identical to her husband
right and that those are the scenes
we're missing
yeah that is the general premise of the
movie is this the
switcheroo yeah there's this whole
pre-first act thing that we're
completely not privy to
yes yes that's the most important thing
for this mystery
and we don't even get flashbacks to it
or anything no no no it just doesn't
exist in this movie it was obvious there
was going to be a twist
i think the only question we had though
amongst ourselves though was
how stupid was the twist going to be yes
why did we underestimate ourselves
i think the safest way to go is a
private charter
you fly to acapulco and then you take a
connection to the bahamas
what about you i'll fly direct
what about the money you take the money
we'll split it when we get there
i think it's safer if we go separately
trump blow up a plane
um that suitcase saying maybe she wants
him to have the money
oh do they have a separate case in the
back so the one in the back's the one
that's got the bomb
the one he took did you ever look
through the case
to not see a bomb apparently they didn't
dig far enough down in the money there's
several layers of money because it threw
it all over the place
starting to get nervous it looks like
she might have a second case in the back
seat i want to
swap them
no no please please don't go i need you
to stay
i didn't ask you for anything nothing
i went out there while you were gone
car's still there
if they found anything the car would be
gone i think the safest way to go is a
private charter
i'm sending a courier with the money a
guy called martin you met him once
before
that was the only part of the plan that
wasn't for proof
not quite when you get to mexico you
check into the cabana hotel
bring this together you share on the
blame
you share the reward i guess the gun is
registered
in alex's name huh okay genius
he told me how you get the cash out you
tell me how you get a million dollars
worth of cash and just walk out of the
country
you fly to acapulco and then you take a
connection to the bahamas
i have to meet someone at an old factory
downtown
i booked your flight you're leaving at
four in the morning
the gun is registered in your husband's
name
now we can go to another country what
about you
i'll fly direct we still could find the
rifle between now and then
sure you want to go through it i don't
have any other option do i
the final switch that wasn't part of the
plan was it
where have you been uh my um uh
what am i gonna do with this in prison
you're not going to prison frank
when's that tonight tonight no
i don't know i'm gonna shoot you at
close range
and then they're gonna find the body and
they're gonna trace the gun to you
then i'm going to put the gun in your
hand
and make it look like a suicide what if
something goes wrong
what could go wrong i don't know you
tell me
i'm sorry you're sorry [ __ ] [ __ ]
stop it frank it's all arranged
because yeah we get because when when uh
she she slits her wrists and he bandages
her up and puts her you know
in bed and she kind of smirks yeah and
that's the thing and we're like oh okay
so she's
a bad guy yeah there's so there's
something there but then it goes another
hour where there's no other hints that
she's
so we're like did we is that just bad
filmmaking did we mistake why she was
smirking
i'm not sure like the movie kept us
engaged
yeah because we wanted to know how it
was going to end
how bad was the twist going it turned
out we were completely wrong
because we thought that some of us were
right
i don't know here's the thing you were
right in the wrong
way i see let's let's
let's explain what the hell was actually
going on
the wife uh his husband was a drug
dealer
and presumably this is presumably on my
part uh the heat was on for the husband
because the fbi is sniffing around
so the plan between the husband who
looks like frank sloan and the wife
was to fake the husband's death which
required him to have
an exact duplicate that looked just like
him
that the wife would seduce uh
convince him that her husband was trying
to
murder her and then that the husband was
going to pretend
that he was going to buy the wife off
with half a million
dollars to leave the country because she
upset
because they are trying to convince
frank stallone
that the husband wanted the wife dead
and at
and then they were gonna ha oh god now
i've gotten lost yeah well so
i've watched the movie and now i've just
gotten lost that's roughly it
the the end the end game though the end
goal is to get
frank stallone to pose as the husband
so he will be on a plane with a suitcase
that he
thinks is full of money but is really a
bomb
and then the husband and wife will
detonate the bomb killing frank stallone
and the authorities will think the drug
dealer husband is dead
and then they can collect the insurance
money and live happily ever after
are you crazy but the double double
cross
is the wife switches the briefcases
because she falls in love with she falls
in love with frank stallone
so she is actually going to kill her
husband
instead but no at the end she's really
still
going to also kill frank stallone for
some
reason i don't know why because she
could get the 10 000
or 10 million dollar life insurance she
could have got that just by
killing the husband yeah she [ __ ] that
up
she [ __ ] that up hard she double
crossed herself so much she got
cross-eyed yeah she lost she lost track
of what was going on here
she lost track of people out of the film
so at the end of the movie women can't
comprehend
double crosses or running away from
giant aids
irresistibly irresistibly mesmerized by
police officers
oh lord that's a different story i
thought i'd stop by
glad you did that's all well no that's
he's an ex-cop in this so it's true here
too
yeah i mean who who couldn't resist
frank stallone
the world
christ wait you didn't know what
she's in november 4 5 7 juliet alpha
with the returning
he didn't know when this was just an
accident
that can't possibly be true i can't wait
to find out
now i am on the edge of my seat the
house
how stupid is frank still up
he left it why did he oh because he
thought
he thought it was going to blow up
oh he left it because he thought he had
the bomb
oh she pulled a double cross what
did she pull a double cross hey what the
hell is going on
i don't know it looks like someone blew
themselves up
come on let's get the hell out of here i
don't think i don't think it works that
way
i think they would ground that plane and
the police would swarm the whole i'm
pretty sure
you know it was the 80s it looks like
someone blew themselves up anyway yeah
let's get out of here [ __ ] away let's
get suspicious about this
if we look at the classic noirs this is
trying to be if we look at like a double
indemnity or something like that like
there's so many so much build up of the
woman is like you know
seducing this man and like yeah
repeatedly yeah she makes no attempt to
seduce you
she just wanders in and then leaves and
then just counts on the idea that frank
stallone is gonna follow her like what
was the purpose of manipulating frank
stallone into murdering somebody in the
old bean factory
okay so it just happened yeah because
she does she calls the cops and reports
the
the gun stolen yes i'd like to report a
stolen weapon
a rifle there's no repercussions from
that yeah
you don't want to give away your mystery
at the beginning and have her and her
husband go
honey i'm go i'm in trouble with the
feds i i need
i need to get out we need to fake my
death you need to find a guy who looks
just like me within a one mile radius
but you need something to hint at that
you can be left wondering early on but
by the end of the movie
you need to understand why everything
happened
and you don't because there really isn't
internal logic for this stuff the plot
revolving around this guy looks exactly
like my husband the i get
idea that these two people look so
identical that if one dies
everyone will think it's the other one
that is stupid it's so absurd
it's the plot of an earnest movie ernest
goes to jail
is a guy that looks just like ernest
switching places with earnest
you can't do that in a film noir the
[ __ ] like clark get glasses that's
all it takes
yeah to make the difference between
these two would this movie even better
if instead of
frank stallone it just starred earnest
the exact same movie same tone but it's
just
mr b mr b
oh that was amazing what what if he
never said a single line oh he's just
he's just walking like he kind of gets
his butt
he's like sniffing her shoes that he
starts doing print falls
is there a scene where he's like with a
briefcase like
he like he like falls into the closet
and discovers his suitcases
the scene where he discovers that she's
committed suicide would be a lot more
hilarious
he's trying to like bandage her wrist
he's like covered
all right rowan atkinson let's get going
i'm not so easy kill that's so easy
you get caught up in a film noir blog
a femme fatale and her drug lord husband
because he looks just like her
ultra suave drug dealers they look
nothing alike
oh johnny whatever
you look just like my husband he's like
super handsome man
it's like brad pitt
any second now i think we're looking for
a brad pitt look-alike
oh you know mr bean has the same name as
somebody who looks
just like brad pitt
oh this is good this is good
she's like helping him along telling him
what's going on
now you're going to hold this briefcase
and you're going to get on the plane
this is the one that's not going to blow
up because i'm going to blow up the
other one in the car
and he's just confused and he's got a
turkey on his head for some reason
you son of a [ __ ]
we've taken a moment and we've uh you
know taken the taking a break and
uh steeled ourselves i think as uh
highly trained professionals
and jay it's time for honorable men
okay please tell me well honorable men
is the most ironically titled film we've
ever done
there's a clear disconnect between what
the filmmaker intended and
what is [ __ ] going on in this movie
a dishonorable man should be the title
yeah actually i think she cares about
other people more than she cares about
herself
she's a real nice girl
want to finish up here sure
well ryan i hope that makes you feel a
little better you get to wear jeans
is it whatever she is she's in training
okay
thanks casey you've been great um cool
okay bro
okay bye i'm glad you're wearing a
skateboard
i'm a big tough comp and all the women
like me
yeah this is a movie about being a cop
and it's it's written directed and
starring
this is a black tank top movie without a
black tank top
there's no physical evidence but
spiritually spiritually it's a black
tank top movie this is a vanity project
a movie clearly made by a guy that has
experience as a cop
hey
we boss look suspicious at all we
shouldn't have gotten a
convertible to do surveillance
he decided to make a movie about what
it's like to be a cop
and also
because the movie jj an honorable
honorable should be the title guys i
don't know why you keep saying the word
fuzz it's getting bleeped out and
there's a black box over here
all those girls are in college that's
true that's right they're all they're
all in college they're all
consenting adults i mean that's
technically true
it feels it feels like they're in high
school based on the scenes and where
particularly the scene when they're at
the high school where they're it's
shot of the high school uh but the one
is a is a
physical therapist intern which means
you've progressed beyond
they don't behave like college kids
i'm sorry i have to tell you this but
ryan said that he thought you were a
[ __ ]
uh uh garrett what's his name garrett
sayer
is the writer director star he plays a
character holy trinity
well yeah it's what we want it's what we
look for the orson welles trinity
yes a triple he's a triple threat well
that's that's the thing is yeah he plays
a character named ryan's babe
who uh who
is a cop he's he's he's he's such a
a good cop he's such a good man he kills
his cop
he he shoots so many black people that
every
young blonde college girl wants to [ __ ]
him
hi this is mandy hi mandy i just called
to say hi oh boy
thanks for helping me with all my
reports
oh god no oh god no
mandy don't do it i'm down oh you know
what it is
it because you're thinking about it too
what made you just say you're clear josh
the the guy who wrote and directed this
also stars and us
and he filmed the scene he filmed these
scenes
he made a point of saying it's very
important for the integrity of the scene
that you're wearing this underwear i
know you want me and that you want me
confident
mandy i guess we should see how serious
you are
no no no no
and so that leads to the plot of the
movie which is that he's in this dilemma
where
there's one girl that wants to [ __ ] him
but then there's this other girl that
also wants to [ __ ] him
but he's so he's got so much work to do
killing black men
that he he doesn't know how he can
handle all these more dilemmas than
woody allen
i gotta add two things to that spiel
this is not [ __ ] his own daughter
no he's [ __ ] his friend's daughter
he's [ __ ] [ __ ] his best friend's
daughter
now he's helping the other girl with her
homework yeah why don't you come over
for dinner tomorrow
sure but what about your dad what do you
mean i mean the age difference
oh he won't mind you're a cop we went to
high school together me and your dad
yeah and his best friend's okay with it
because they're honorable they're cops
he's one of the two acceptable
professions
there's cubs cop military men those are
the two he's
both yeah he has military background
yeah new cop
yeah in the ux navy yep you can [ __ ] my
daughter
all right thank you get into the
spaghetti thank you for your service
now service my daughter some spaghett
have a spaghetti that was in the navy
too aviation firefighter great
tell you that was a whole lot better
deal than what i'm doing now busting
drug dealers in the middle
and [ __ ] your daughter and making
shitty movies
but yeah two things about that because
one girl's blonde one girl's brunette
they can't even resist him not even just
the blondes also
he doesn't just shoot the black people
he shoots the brown people too that's
true that's true
the movie starts with with uh ryan's
babe going to a crack house
and they all go to the house and they're
all wearing like vests and helmets
except for this partner
because he doesn't need to wear that
[ __ ] he's too powerful he's bulletproof
so he gets shot and uh
he gets shot and we flash back to a year
earlier where he is a guest speaker at a
college course
and then we get that's when we get that
looks like a high school class that
looks like a high school classroom
and then we get two different college
girls hitting on him one after the other
and both those college girls are rivals
with each other so that's some
uh extra conflicts i guess they are
although they don't
really well they're they're right a
whole lot it factors
like one of them right at the beginning
right at the beginning they're caddy
with each other and then they kind of
don't
talk about it for an hour no it it
barely factors in
what's her name mandy mandy is the
blonde
um girl burnett is burnett
you're mandy and you came
and you gave oh without taking gross
oh you should send her away look this is
based on a true story okay this is just
what happened
you know the feud quiet quiets down
early on because early on mandy asserts
her dominance
over ryan well she tries to oh but ryan
is too much
man for her yeah she says you're too
much man for me
i don't think we should do that anymore
what yeah
well i respect my dad what
i respect my dad can't hear over my
boner what
maybe he wouldn't like us doing this as
long as i take care of you and treat you
right i don't think you'll mind
well i do so
it is
we can't be together because you are too
much man for me i can't control you
also and then and then zero scenes later
she's [ __ ] him yeah this is not an
exaggeration
they don't [ __ ] right away he goes and
buys her a teddy bear
oh yeah gives her the teddy bear then
she he buys the teddy bear from a young
blonde
he would have to buy her a gift from a
toy store right
where wherever oh yeah we should mention
that it says at the very beginning of
the movie based on truth based on a true
story whether it is or not
whatever that means and it's not really
a very compelling true story
who initiates a
a love triangle with women that are much
younger than him and then gets
kind of shot in a drug raid and dies
spoilers spoilers not the most
compelling of real life stories uh no
he initiates this this situation mandy
he does not have sex with her right away
he goes out and buys her a stuffed bear
then
she gets a little horny and gets on the
phone and
but then invites invites him over to
have dinner with dad
ryan you're welcome anytime excuse me
i'll be back in a minute
thanks chad i really enjoyed it welcome
thank you thanks
thanks thanks mandy thanks for cooking
dinner bye
appreciate it have the spaghett
that cheap spaghetti is the spaghett
first
before is the spaghett before the bath
yep yes yes and and the underwear
and the the tight underwear yeah with
the
yeah and she's like i know you want me
then the bear which by the way
the way she delivers that is out of like
a poison ivy movie
but ivy didn't just want a friend
ivey wanted more i know
oh yeah poison ivy with drew barrymore
no the movie poison ivy where she
seduces tom skerritt
who is also one of the sexiest men alive
tom skerritt
young teenage drew barrymore seduces him
but it's funny you mentioned drew
barrymore because they go to see a movie
called
never been kissed because of course
evans and i
were in is that effect yes that's a fact
we were extras film experts so we were
face that was shot in the chicago area
yeah
right rich evans and i the navy piercing
we went to drew barrymore and her
male co-star well who is it who is the
male coaster

place at navy pier and drew barrymore

with her male co-star and they that was
the entire scene
and they needed extras on navy pier
playing around on all of the rides and
rich evans and i went and did that
and it took 17 hours to film one scene
17 hours and they put me on the swings
that went for 17 hours yeah for for
about
two hours and i said oh get me off
swings
yeah i said i said i gotta throw up
and i at that point it was like four in
the morning and they don't care
because when you're an extra you're like
you're like cattle to them they they
literally heard you around
yes rich i didn't know where rich evans
was and i'm like
i was like stop where where were you
right i was just in a crowd with a
complete literally they put me together
like a complete stranger were holding
like a balloon
yeah but i was like i was like get me
off the swings i gotta throw up
because they fed us terrible food and
that's what you're an expert i'm gonna
throw up and i
they put me on swing for two hours
meanwhile drew barrymore was going
around
on the ferris wheel for for two hours
filling her scene and i was like get me
off the swings
and so i was like i gotta sit down and i
gotta sit down i sat down
and i was like oh my god i feel i i
seriously felt like because i throw up
and and some person came over and gave
me water
because they knew i looked sick and i
looked up
and about 10 feet away was drew
barrymore sitting in her actor's tent
and there was six people around fanning
her do not make eye contact with miss
barrymore
and i was like oh i don't give two
flying
[ __ ] anymore i just want to go home

was like 5 30 5 00 a.m
5 30 a.m we left we started at like five
in the afternoon too right oh wow yeah

and so the next day i called because it
was for two more days
to shoot the seat on navy beer and i
called up the guy who was in charge of
the casting i said

because because it was awful
it was a terrible experience he's like
hold on you [ __ ] [ __ ]
i'm gonna put you on on i'm gonna put
you on the call with the director of the
film
what the [ __ ] yes yes he was he was like
like threatening me he's like he's like
um where were you standing
because wherever you're standing it's
going to cause a continuity error
and drew barrymore is not going to be
very happy about continuity
and he's like i'm going to put you on
the phone with that that's already just
go and i said i'm not showing up
i said me and rich evans are not showing
up and i hung up the phone
that was the end of that i usually stand
out and talk to the director and explain
what the problem why did you put me on
the phone with the director of the film
it was
it was an empty threat it wasn't sure he
was not going to put you on the phone
but i told him me and rich evans we're
not coming back and we're not
getting on your on your rides oh jesus
because it made me sick and i was gonna
[ __ ] puke on drew barrymore's [ __ ]
face
i didn't care [ __ ] that movie never been
kissed
[ __ ] that movie
mandy you're drunk
leave ryan alone he's an honorable man
you're drunk and you're in your 90s
grunge face yeah
i've been watching the so-called live
all day long
mandy chose her drug party friends over
ryan so ryan spends time with brunette
girl orion arrest
mandy's friends which causes mandy to
break up with ryan
yeah she calls him an [ __ ] when she's
so devastated
by breaking up with this wonderful
specimen of man
always but she's also like she has a bit
of a goth phase after yeah which is
great
[ __ ] but but to ryan's
credit ryan smith aka garrett sayer
director he's through all the [ __ ]
he does say in the police station he's
like
these these young ladies are just good
for sex
i don't want to deal with that girl's
dad in front of all their dads
not just the brunette girl all their
dads specifically he's [ __ ]
all of their daughters i'm the dad of
the girl she's been [ __ ] yes yeah
he's like he's like all these girls are
good for his sex none of your
your daughters are worth living with or
being married to they're practically
children
he said that these psycho nutcase women
are too friggin emotional for me
especially that one i think all they're
good for is sex
when you start to care about them you
get involved in their crazy world
where nothing is logical everything is
emotional
and their parents want them home by
midnight i think that's all they're good
for is sex
i'm too old to go to prom
jesus christ but ryan is an honorable
man
that's honorable i remember you in
braids and braces
i brought you something what
myself oh yeah we gotta talk about the
uh
uh the gas station scene the convenience
store scene and so
so ryan's babe and his partner walk into
this convenience store one day
and they're just looking around like and
talking to the blonde lady who works at
the station
also a young blonde woman yeah that's
total coincidence who couldn't imagine
that such a thing would happen
i wonder what his type is is she always
that caring
yeah actually i think she cares about
other people more than she cares about
herself
she's a real nice girl
uh but so uh they're they're hanging
around the back and all of a sudden a a
brown
fella walks in i should say it's up to
no good
just one more this is
i have to rescue this pretty white lady
hold on
from this filthy brown i'm gonna i got
something stuck up my butt
that robber should just shoot him five
times right in the chest
i will walk right up to you because i'm
awesome
no no no no he's already got it she just
runs right to him oh thank you hugs him
thank you he's not even the one that did
it
yeah yay
whites get it done
yeah the partner saves the day but she
immediately
is like thank you ryan's babe for saving
me yeah he didn't do anything he didn't
do [ __ ]
man was just stealing money for his
children's insulin
now he's going to spend 40 years in
prison because garrett sayer is so
goddamn he's handsome he's just
irresistible well it's the thing
i think he's i think he's actually
partial to that brunette because he's
known ever so long
which is also kind of creepy yeah we get
a flashback where he's like
where he remembered well i guess she
remembers when
she's like 12 or something for her yeah
to have dinner with her father
she's she's got some tails and glasses
and she's like hunching down her seat so
she looks tiny she's like i want to
marry a cup so she walks in eventually
walks into his
uh totally coca-cola decorated house and
says i love you i don't care if
you do if you love me but i love you
i've been thinking about this idea that
i've had of you and i
all these years that maybe one day you
would love me
she looks like a like a hostage
forced through the gun is right off here
to read a hostage level
you don't have to run away i know you
don't feel the same way but
i just wanted to let you know that i
love you and that
i know you never had any intention of
hearing this line crossing
yeah yeah pretty bad okay bye that's
that
i'm gonna go sit on the beach and then
he goes out there and then they kind of
like hug for a little bit
and then mandy shows up again she's like
uh you can kiss me wherever you want
and then he goes and gets shot and dies
the end
you don't have to kiss me there
you can kiss me anywhere you want to
um uh oh okay um
what about other girl yeah she loves it
whatever he's gone
every girl loves him don't you know that
don't you know that
how much more of this [ __ ] is there
uh two hours
god damn it this is a four-hour long
movie
it's peter jackson's jackson
honorable hobbit
he's using forced perspective to make
the girls look a little bit bigger
is that before after he says i want to
suck the spaghetti out of your mouth
he doesn't say it he implies it by doing
it
he doesn't say he wants to he just goes
ahead and sucks the spaghetti out of her
mouth hole
she actually says you you can suck the
spaghett out of my butthole
i miss that yeah i missed that party
it's still digesting
yeah that's months later that's weird
it's literally months later
wow because she had the tummy problem oh
that's right she had a tummy ache it was
a
it was called uh vld very long digestion
of spaghetti blds it's a very common
syndrome that occurs in virginia
your stomach hurts where is your stomach
she's the naughty one out of the two
female leads the other one even the
other one did say like she she wanted to
pose for playboy
i think i'm just gonna pose for playboy
what do you think
you definitely have what it takes gross
my dad even thinks it's a good idea
oh oh it wouldn't be one to argue with
your dad
didn't have to say that please don't
she did and her dad was totally fine
with it yeah like hey whatever you could
do to make money you're dumb
physical money you gotta [ __ ] the
elderly cop or opposed dude or do both
you got two choices honorable men
it's a movie about a cop who was
irresistible to
college aged girls who
oh let's not forget his college
professor friend who he
learned from that's clearly 10 years
younger than him yeah
yeah right right well that's the scene
where because we it's a bizarre
bizarre it's
hypothetical speaking there could have
been a a real story
about like a 23 year old cop
who got shot in the line of duty and he
had some relationship issues with
uh the the daughter of the veteran
sergeant who had a 20 year old daughter
look at like well yeah cass the 45 year
old man
what would you say you cast you're
talking about the guy that cast the
movie you cast yourself when you cast
yourself
45 year old man in that room that's
irresistible to
18 year yeah
see that's what we're talking that's
when the black tank top is a
sheer effect we're talking about the
neil breen faithful findings even though
he didn't do anything
yeah he was irresistible to that 16 year
old new brain in his last movie had the
common sense
even though he he wrote the 16 year old
big attracted to him
at least the character turned her the
[ __ ] down yeah that's true
you can't do this anymore
he he at least had that border there i
understand that
or gedivin i mean he you know he
had the the playboy model or whatever it
was that he was completely irresistible
too right
i i don't remember i've not seen the
whole movie i've only seen the episode
but yeah we've got we the problem is
we've got that crossover here
in the ego between i am irresistible to
women
and i am irresistible to young women
that i should not be [ __ ]
and there's no connection between him uh
young women being attracted to
him and him being a cop that gets shot
in the line of duty no
there's no connection between those two
things cops are honorable men
and all women are attracted to honorable
men it's just that all the women that
are around are of college age
there are no older women in this movie
it's slim pickings in virginia
apparently yeah
they're college age but their their high
school
literature teacher is is teaching them a
high school level play yeah and they're
throwing tardies for 14 year olds
because that's who gets arrested or
whatever
oh except the ramones are there there's
no one there oh those dudes the ramones
are there
who invited them they just show up
they came to play their song
it's virginia josh because full
disclosure okay
uh the three of us have watched this
movie once already
we realized how majestic and magical it
was so we wanted to do it on an episode
i'm glad you showed it to me i
appreciate being that person did
uh garrett sayer look vaguely familiar
to you at all
vaguely because he uh another movie that
was shot in virginia
that we've done previously on best of
the worst
uh is the satan killer
where the writer director star is the
[ __ ]
brother of garrett sayer what are you
trying to tell me
it's steven sayer no we made fun of his
is his imdb image that looks like a mug
shot
and this is his brother
oh both both have experience in law
enforcement
both are inept filmmakers apparently
incompetence and screenwriting once in
the family
[ __ ] out didn't they almost make a
reference to satan killers
i don't know i think no i don't i don't
think i got it out they made a joke
about satanists yeah they did yes
the occupants are also believed to be
involved in witchcraft
so they'll probably try to cast some
sort of a voodoo spell on us
this is your class yes they did they did
i think i was trying to get something
around that and there were bikers
and i was trying to get some oh [ __ ]
hell
we didn't realize until afterwards we
looked it up on imdb and we were like
wait a minute
so this is the product of a [ __ ]
dynasty is what you're talking oh yeah
yeah
yeah a long history of making an
incompetent cop film
holy [ __ ] all right all right all right
how old are you
hey hey watch me chug this milk
i feel like king kong they're chugging
snapple jay i'm still standing here
and seeing what was that scene
kate's mcfadden oh no there's two roads
in honorable men
one is kind of like drug drug guy plot
right
honorable man stops drug dealers
right yeah gets shot in the end yeah
right right
road to his honorable man has relations
with
young women okay who can't get their
hands off him because he's so handsome
yeah
he's so awesome he's a cop he's a
military man and a cop and that's all
the ladies want
neither plot have i ever have a
sufficient
beginning middle or end no then
the movie stops yes
is this the end yep it is yes
what why
what
mike yeah what's the best of the worst
oh boy
yeah i don't even have an answer myself
oh you know what about it you know what
josh i got
i'm gonna have to go god
rich it's not the easiest no no no you
think about it
i have to consult with my best friend 25
years for chubbin
you've never been a kiss co-star but
never been kissed co-star
we were in a drew barrymore film
together we've been through hell
together
do i pick the film with the ape or the
ch but i got one thing
have you ever seen a film like honorable
men
is that new to the palette as opposed to
a giant as opposed to a giant name
have you seen a giant eight-month boring
thriller mike have you ever written this
movie before my pick for best of the
worst is
honorable men all right because
uh it is the most embarrassing vanity
project i've ever seen
and that is get even get even gideon is
the most embarrassing
vanity project this is the most
uncomfortable vanity project this is
like this is like gawking at a
car wreck where where a bus full of
crashed into a bus full of teenage girls
uh but so rich is uh uh are we gonna
segue into that is that
i know is weird it is you don't you
don't feel good about it you don't feel
good about it but
in terms of best of the worst yeah
it is the best of the worst because it
is unique it's shocking
it's shocking watching it and then
somebody thought this was okay
yes yes yes
oh he's i think he's looking around he's
gonna start reaching his hand
it wouldn't be surprising he's an
honorable man he's an honorable man
you just he just want to make sure no
one knows around because he came in his
pants
honorable men only have sex with
children when it's consensual
which it never is
at no point during the production of the
film did anyone say
hey don't do this
right yeah there was no one to say no
jay
uh it's it's honorable men
i don't feel good about this but it's
honorable men what a pervert
i [ __ ] i [ __ ] knew jay would pick
the convertibles
we just we just we just we just baited
him into that yeah
my real pick was easy kill no no that's
the thing is like i mean
honorable men is fascinating in general
but especially compared to ape or easy
kill like those movies are kind of
boring
they have their charm they they have
their charm they they both have their
charms
if you're going to watch it with a group
i i got a feeling ape might please more
people
look at the sets yeah in a generic like
mystery science theater way yes it's the
perfect mystery science theater movie
that was never on mystery science
yeah honorable men is like the advanced
bad movie
to watch it's the ap course you've seen
you've seen everything else
it's a big course of bad movies
where you're in this psychological
realm of the film why would you do this
we have done
we have done this idea at least 101
times at least 101 times not counting
all the times we did it
just for fun when we thought oh
sweet youth when we just enjoyed this as
a pastime
yeah but in terms of yeah in terms of
like crowd pleasing
ape 100 sure that's a super fun movie
you could show to your friends
everything makes sense you can hear all
the dialogue you know you bad costumes
foam sides these the apes flipping off
everybody yeah yeah
yeah when the military guys are talking
that's when everybody gets drinks or
nachos
totally take a little break come back
for the eight miniature action
you have no point to leave during
honorable men because you're gonna miss
something
[ __ ] weird easy kill easy kill ended
up just pissing us off
frankly yeah because it tried
to be more than it was it's just
stupidly written
yeah i've never seen anything like
honorable men
what what what is it and i try to just i
cannot wrap my
my brain around it i have to pick it i
can't not pick it
because as much as it makes me feel
desperately uncomfortable
we have some serious problems out there
because of alcohol and drug abuse
and i would call it the main problem our
society has
today i'm sorry i had to tell you this
but
ryan said that he thought you were a
[ __ ] you [ __ ]
[ __ ]
best of the worst can we stab easy kill
no oh you know oh hold up oh [ __ ]
oh you got it oh i feel it too yeah oh
weird
some kind of text alert yeah yeah [ __ ]
oh man another update jesus christ
oh i guess the cdc is requiring massing
all right great that's great
i'm gonna have my mask here i just can't
i'm gonna be able to see this this will
protect me from
coronavirus jesus i still don't know how
this is gonna protect from corona virus
i can't
i can't even see through this thing
better put the whole thing on
do you guys see no no me neither
oh boy
boy
it's just too big for a small world like
ours
