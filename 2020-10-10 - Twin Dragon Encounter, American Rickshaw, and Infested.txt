and that was the real reason why i stopped appearing in red letter media video's for so long
it was quite a journey
oh, hi jack
don't mind me
i was just writing in my journal
what are we doing today
well, today, we're going to watch three movies
three whole movies
we haven't done this in a while
we haven't just picked three movies to watch
there's always been some kind of stupid gimmick, or some kind of crap
but today we're just watching three movies
no spinning
no spin
no dropping
no dropping
just picking three movies 
three movies straight up
we're gonna watch 'em
first up
a lot of people might remember this movie from the plinketto board
mmhmm
and you have a special story
you discovered this movie, jack
this is, when we started doing best of the worst, or when you guys started doing the best of the worst, cuz i wasn't in the first episode
this was the first tape that i brought in as a possible inductee into best of the worst
found it in a little thrift store in minnesota
