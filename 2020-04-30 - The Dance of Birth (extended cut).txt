Oh, my god.
That's not dancing.
Is this a cult?
Is there gonna be a mass suicide?
This is a brainwashing video.
Oh, Jesus.
Eww.
She knew she was on camera, right?
Yeah, but the oil all over her face didn't.
Eww!
Oh, no!
What was that.
What was that.
She was waiting.
The baby was due any second.
The baby's like, please, send help, someone adopt me.
This was shot on the other side of the conference center that Allen Funt shot his video.
Those ladies were actually in his video.
They're in Volume 5.
Yeah, that's how they all got pregnant.

The lack of any music in this dancing video is very unsettling.
I'm sorry.
If someone saw you dancing like this before you got pregnant, they wouldn't have got you pregnant in the first place.
Maybe this is intended as birth control.
Just dance like this, and no man will ever want to knock you up.

Uh.
Okay.
The time has come for me to shut this off.

She just appeared there.
I guess she just appeared.
We need to prepare our bodies before a watermelon rips through your genitals.
My god.
Wow, that's the best description of birth I've ever heard.
That doesn't--
Nobody's--
That doesn't do that.
This isn't dancing.
This is, everybody's doing their own thing.
I know.
She just said it makes more room in your torso.
Like it opens it up.
That's not possible.
I would trust a doctor more than I would trust this fucking hippie.

Is there anything instructional about this?
No.
Dance like a hippie.
Step one: flail around.
Step two: flail around.

What was the cameraman thinking?
Can I get paid in advance?
We'll pay you with royalties from the sale.
No.
No.
No, I wanna get paid in advance please.
Cash.

She's wearing her wireless microphone, and she's saying stuff.
Oh, yeah.
So, it's like--
Weird.
They shot it, and then--
They realized it was fucked up or something?
They couldn't use it, yeah.
And, so, maybe she was giving instruction, and then, not them, put some bullshit voice-over on it.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh, the guys.
That poor man.
No, there's another guy.
This is, oh no.
He's thinking, I hate my life.
Are those both the dad?
Are those both the dad.
So, is this supposed to help you while you're pregnant, or after you've had the child?
I'm unsure what it's supposed to do.
It's just cutting to both.
Is it supposed to make you have the child easier, or--
What is the purpose of this video?
Only the hippie lady knows for sure.

I give up.

She' just saying things.
She' just saying things.
"Mobility."

Right over to your womb space, that's your womb.
Isn't it?
When you're editing this, can you add in, like, weird squishing sounds as they move.
And farts, please.
And farts.
Your voice would add farts when they're squatting.
Nothing but farts.
Wait till she says, "Open yourself up."
That is what happens when you oxygenate your womb space.

Is it just gonna be this the whole way through?
Yep.
Uh, there's been no indication of, like, things that need instruction.
There's no, like, "Dance #1."
Right, right.
"Let's try this, dance #2."
Give us some breathing exercises to--
Yeah, yeah.
It is just, yeah, yeah.
Maybe, like--
Stretch or meditate or--
Yeah, something--
If they're just gonna undulate for--
It's just people flailing around with weird voice-over.
It's almost fascinating.
Well, there's all these different locations and different types of footage mixed together.
Yeah.
Like, there's the footage of her with the mic, like they intended to film some sort of instructional video, and then they said, well, we don't have enough.
Let's film this, and let's film a class here--
Yeah.
There's different locations.
And they just, yeah, slap all this together.
Just put it all together, and just do a voice-over bit.
And this is the purple screen that didn't key out right, so they never used it properly, right?
It's like it's keyed out, but it's not.
It's very weird.
It's keyed out.
Why aren't they using it more?
Why aren't they putting things behind them?
If it was keyed out, you wouldn't see the shadow quite like that, though.

Rich Evans, will you do the dance of birth?
No.
Oh, you can show him squatting, but it's just a fart.
That poor baby.

You see, this is the point where Allen Funt comes into the room right now with us, like, "I got you!"
"Didn't you wonder?"
"Didn't you wonder?"
"You thought this was a real video, huh?"

What?
What does that mean?
Can you put this in a context that might make sense to a rational mind?

What's that one lady doing?
What are any of them doing?
She's doing the chicken dance!
Wouldn't it be great if there was one woman during this class that just kept asking, "What does that mean?"
"Can you explain what that means?"
"Are we going to learn anything?"
"Timeout, what is this?"
"This is a big scam, isn't it?"
"When you say channel my energy through my center, what does that mean?"
Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.
What.
They're getting mad.
They're like, "Get me out of this class."
They're dancing, and one dances out the door.

Man.
"Union."
It doesn't connect to anything.
This is like, uh--
She suddenly felt like saying "union".
Yeah, it's a word.
This is like Ghostworld.
Have you ever seen, you've probably seen Ghostworld.
Oh, yeah, a ton.
When the, our teacher is showing her film, and the film is just like, "Father, mirror, father..."

Okay, if they dance like that, they're gonna harm their babies.
"Your baby came out all fucked up."
"What did you do?"
"But all I did was follow an instructional video."
"Uh, ma'am, there's only half a baby here."
"It seems it broke in half."
"Were you violently dancing while pregnant?"
"It would seem like your baby opened up."
"Your baby is trying to show me his center."
"I mean, your baby is inside out."
Your baby's inside out.
"That when the baby threw up...inside it's own womb."
These are the one's that are really drugged out.
What did you do?
The baby's just spinning around.
The baby threw up.
Oh, the baby threw up.
I thought you meant that she was ugly or something.
Oh, well, that, too.
This is the most pointless thing I've ever seen.
It's amazing that it's gone on for 27 minutes without ever changing gears.
I can't believe this is a video.
Wait.
What's cooking?
Parts cooking?
Now the drugs are really kicking in.
This sounds like the music in Ghostbusters when all the ghosts are getting loose.

What the fuck is this?
What is happening?
I keep waiting for a punchline.
I'm gonna take these words and put them into a linear script and just read them, and see if it makes any fucking sense.
I'm gonna tell you right, it won't.
Oh, this is the freakout scene.
Everyone be quiet.
See, you're waiting for me laugh.
It's too much pressure.
It's too much pressure.
Do you know what a kegel is?
A kegel?
What's a kegel?
It's a vaginal exercise.
It's to keep it tight.
Oh.
The last thing you want to do when you have a vagina is be tighter when a baby's ripping through you.
Right, Rich?
I've never heard the word kegel before.
"Right, Rich."
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
It's the dirtiest joke on Futurama.
They're in an exercise, uh, gym--
Yeah.
And they're walking by, and in the foreground, you don't see her bottom half, you see this woman, she keeps making faces like this, and the top of her machine she's working on says the Kegelcizer.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no.
Oh, my god.
It changed.
That was escalating, and now--
It was escalating to the birth.
This is symbolizing birth, right?
Yeah.
Cuz her head is in that other girl's vagina.
Right.
And that's her vagina.
And now there's a baby's head in her vagina.
This is very deep.
This is very, uh, well-executed, as far as what it's trying to convey visually.
Mm.
What.

"Breathing in friends"?
Is that what she said?
Yeah.
"Breathing in friends."
I'm assuming it's "breathing in", comma, "friends".
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know, actually, with this.
Was their energy, maybe, you know, like, "breathing in their friends."
Breathing in your friends's energy.
Sure, sure.
I get it.
I'm hip.
They ran out of music and voice-over.
Yeah.
Room for what, another one?
For dance.

You have to pay more to get the other videocassette tape that finishes all of her sentences.
"I'm...at...the...gas...station."
"My...car...broke..."
"Yes, yes?"
"...down."
"I...need...a...tow...truck."
"No, just a toe."
"It's for an art project."

And I have a feeling that guy with the beard, his co-workers found this tape and showed it to him, and then he shot up the workplace.
I have no doubt that that happened.
"Hey, George, look at this."
They're all laughing at him.
"Oh, no."
He comes back with a shotgun to the construction site.
Takes everyone out, and himself.
That's the only thing that can come of this.

This can't be much longer, right?
I don't know.
There's no way.
I feel like she's repeating herself at this point.
She's full of herself enough to think this means something, too.
I wonder what she's up to now.
We have to look her up.
That's actually a great idea.
Yeah, yeah.
We need to find out Dance of Birth, and where this lady is.

Oh, no.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
Look at all that breast milk.
I don't wanna know what's happening here.
It's Sigourney Weaver.
Oh, god.
Sigourney Weaver.
She sleeps above her covers.
Three feet above her covers.
Did she die?
That which nour-, nourishes, okay.
These are very important things she's saying.
Food nourishes me.
Look, there's a cat.
They just stopped--
They just cut to a cat.
The guy's putting no establishing--
A cat and a field.
This symbolizes insanity, right?
Like, this portion of the video?
This is the sanest thing I've heard in the last hour.
They actually showed a cat.

What?
No!
Now we're going back to earth.
I would love to get back to earth.
Why did it show the earth?
Because--
Mother earth.
...mother earth, nature-nurture garbage.

What?
Why?
Eww.
Everyone's ugly.
Everyone is so ugly!
Oh, my god.
Which one gets blown up?
This one, or Candid Camera?
Look it, there's the edge of the room.
Candid Camera.
Oh, my god.
Oh, no.
I don't know.
Candid Camera is more depressing.
Oh, no.
It's gonna hit it.
It's gonna hit it.
No!
Touch it.
Touch it.
Touch it!
Oh, my god.
Aww.
Uh, uh, uh...
Aww.
Boy, I dunno, I kinda wanna blow this up.
This is giving us amusement.
It is, but fuck this lady.
Oh, sure.
I would like a rewatch.
I bet she's doing something with dolphins now.
"Swim with the dolphins."

Or maybe she' just a, like, conwoman through and through, and right now, she's selling bogus timeshares, or something.
That would be great.
She's counting her hundreds of dollars that she made off of this.
I would actually have more respect for her, if that was the case.
Yeah, yeah.
If she genuinely believes whatever this is supposed to be, then--
If you could dupe 30-40 people into being in your stupid video--
And they're probably paying a lot of money for this, too.
Yeah.
They're probably not actors getting paid to be in the video.
They have some kind of class she teaches.
No, I doubt that that lady is any sort of an actor.
Yeah, yeah.
They're real mothers--
Yeah.
...who are taking this.
Signed up for a class, yeah.
"$500 for the class, and you'll be in touch with your child."
And then she goes back, and she's smoking, and she's like, "When's the video done?"
I would have more respect for her if that was the case, but I think she believes this nonsense.
Yeah, yeah.

I can't believe this is still going on.
I know.
Are we done now?
At this point,  I want to finish this.
This isn't like the Candid Camera, where, it's like, okay, I get it.
Yeah.
This is like, I will never get this.
Yeah.
And I want to stick it out.
Well, this, there is nothing to get.
It's New Age nonsense.
Yeah, yeah.
But how long can this possibly go on?
48 minutes we're at now.
Did we check the running time before we started?
The tape was light, though.
Like, you know, when it's lighter, there's less tape inside.
This can't be more than an hour.
Well, when it's lighter, though, sometimes they do SOP.
And they can fit a feature-length movie on an SOP tape.
Ooh.
That's what they used to do with the cheapo movies back in the day.
Yeah, yeah.
My first copy of Evil Dead was like that.
Yeah.
They, this is, it can't.
It's impossible.
How much longer can this possibly go on.
Oh, god.
We've seen the earth.
And there's the earth again.
I feel, that was earth, yeah.
Wait.
Are we sure...
I feel like we're watching the sequel at this point.
Yeah.
Like, this is their second pregnancy.
The background changed.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
Maybe this is the cooldown?
Oh, god.
Please let it be.
I thought the cooldown was 20 seconds ago.
Oh, no.
Now we're in the sky.
I wanna see the kit again.
It sounds like a wrap up, though.
That baby needs its fingernails clipped.
It might be over.
Thank Christ.
Oh, god.
Yay, we made it.
Oh, her name is Melissa Michaels.
Melissa Michaels.
It's a very generic name.
Yeah.
We'll find stuff.
Melissa Michaels, Dance of Birth.
Dance of Birth, yeah.
Or hippie, or New Age.
There's a lot of things you can search with that name.
Those's all the names of all the people dancing in it.
I would not want my name on this shit.
Well, I really feel like we've gone through an experience together here.
Yeah.
It's like in Stand By Me, where the kids go through a little event, and they come out different people in the end.
Yeah.
Is that The Dance of Birth?
This is the newly-created DVD version of The Dance of Birth.
We're gonna, uh, redistribute it, then bring it back.
Yeah?
Yes.
As a suicide assistant?
Yes.
Now we're gonna try and find this person, Melissa Michaels.
Yeah.
Melissa Michaels.
Melissa Michaels, M dot E-D.
Is that what it said it was?
I think so.
So, what are we doing, Jay?
We're trying to find Melissa Michaels.
Who's that?
She's the Dance of Birth lady.
I think the appropriate, there she is.
Look at her website.
It hasn't been updated since 1997.
Oh, my god.
It's in comic sans.
Her main font on her website is comic sans.
Facebook page, The Dance of Birth, information and answers, Dance of Birth DVD.
It was released on DVD.
Let's investigate this.
"This instructional video teaches pregnant women and new mothers to connect deeply with their bodies."
Okay, that's definitely it.
So, there was a DVD release of this at some point.
Uh, yeah, looks like the best information we have to go off of is her facebook page.
Of what's she doing now?
"Please join us."
"Movement Mass."
"Sunday, March 24th."
"Stillness and Movement."
"Dancing into the Spaciousness."
Oh, my god.
Look at that DVD.
That's amazing.
"Birthing embodies..."
I don't know what any of this means.
It doesn't mean anything, Jay.
Well, it's good to know she hasn't changed at all.
This is supposed to be pictures of elderly African women and sunsets.
This looks like the facebook page that this woman should have.
This is amazing.
