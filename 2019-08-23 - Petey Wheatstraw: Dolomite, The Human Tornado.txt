uh, so we're here for another spotlight episode
we were inspired by the recent release of the trailer for the motion picture cats
yes
to talk about Rudy ray Moore films
but first we have to talk about our sponsor, loot crate
uh, but in all seriousness, I'm excited about the Rudy ray Moore biopic
written by the guys that wrote Ed Wood
that is amazing
and starring Eddie Murphy looking like he gives a shit
I'm very excited
it's shocking
not since the days of The Adventures of Pluto Nash has, has eddie Murphy looked so excited to be in a film
I'm in the minority where I loved Pluto Nash
that's fine
but that's another conversation for another day
that's a review that you'll have to do completely by yourself
can you, can it just be me in both chairs
look at me just
talking about how great Randy Quaid is
the awkward robot
I'm very excited he doesn't look
anything like Rudy ray Moore but he
looks like he's having a good time and
that's all that matters
as long as as long as it's a fun story
loosely based on Rudy ray Moore's
experiences I'm sure he looks at least
as much like the very more as the guy
who used to do it on MADtv was that a
thing that was a thing this is your
first first Rudy or any more experience
what a way to start what uh what are
your initial takeaways on Rudy ray Moore
as a persona Oh glorious overall the is
sure likes to yell it's such a strong
vision for a movie and this is not me
over exaggerating like he knew exactly
what he wanted this movie to look like
yeah and this is it like it's comedy
it's drama it's social commentary it's a
devil with a crane I'm cleaning up the
streets man it's great I think the
comedy is an important thing to point
out because as we've often said on best
of the worst is that bad comedies are
usually miserable yeah
PT wheat straw is a comedy but it's not
miserable it's it's legitimately funny
in parts mm-hmm and when it's not it's
funny because it's so awkward and weird
that's really my big question is what is
it because because I mean we have to
bring up the blaxploitation genre and
earth and is this a blaxploitation film
or is it just a comedy film yes yeah I
would say it's both okay it's got
elements of blaxploitation yeah
blaxploitation you know you have like
your shafts or like the Pam Grier movie
one o'clock yeah dolomite is you're
gonna have to take me
well Dola Dola might was like Rudy ray
Moore was you know he did stage
performances he did comedy and then so
he kind of brought that to the
blaxploitation genre by doing more
comedic stuff Dolomites where he you
know does awkward kung-fu and rhymes man
move over and let me pay foldout to be
pulling these hush puppies out followed
by human tornado where he does awkward
kung fu and rhymes and then culminating
in PD weed straw where he does not play
the dhol my character but he does
awkward kung fu and II rhyme yes you can
trust the devil hey who knows that
Daniel Webster thing can you still
brought two delays back this time is
over
no more hearty can pain
I feel like this is classic independent
film where all these ideas they just
like I want kung fu in my movie I want
comedy I want big ass jokes I want the
devil
I want a heart-wrenching scene where a
child dies I want to talk about the
morality of sending winos to hell and so
they just put on screen what they wanted
to see and that is so heartwarming
yeah that's fantastic it's what it's
it's what makes the movie a unique thing
I love that just like we need to hide
whoever's lifting the bed up and down
and just put a chair that's great
PT wheat straw is born at 8 years old
during a big storm that opening senior
anyway that's like a Mel Brooks scene or
something like it's very that that's
like over-the-top goofy yeah those
cutaways and then he gets to a woman on
bed with a cartoonish pregnant belly
which I guess makes sense because she
gives birth to a fully grown like
teenage child
don't know where you got to stop so
close you know mere getaway wood and the
watermelon but that's something yeah
before it before PD comes out a
watermelon comes out and then
watermelons become a reoccurring thing
throughout the movie I think what
they're going for is like we're gonna
take this kind of you know stereotype
and just blow it up to absurdity yeah
but literally literally they blow up
watermelon truck at one point so I think
that's the goal there they're mocking
their their audience then they blow up
the whole truck yeah with the bomb from
the toilet that the devil scepter finds
a vibrating but don't forget that also
PT wheat straw when he's having is
karate training that's right Oh
watermelon yeah repeatedly with the
sword mat that's some symbolism right
there got to you right but what does a
cucumber bean oh they ran out of
watermelons that's a film it's a ballad
oh they're they're trying that's their
plan masculinity oh you know cuz you
know PB wheat straw is obviously a very
masculine character everyone listen but
his masculinity isn't as important as
his care for the community which
generally is thought of as more of a
feminine trait and so he's playing with
gender roles very early on and I think
that's great
as long as the members of that community
aren't winos homeless people are not
even human beings to be tea we'd stir we
saw Flavor Flav's grandfather fall into
an open grave and then PD we'd strepek's
it's funny just to bury him alive
kicked all the dirt above you let's bury
this hobo well it's it's important to
mention pity wheat straw he's born as an
8 year old he gets trained by a karate
master
yeah he just wanders by one day sees
Peter getting beat up and says hey I'm
gonna teach you karate teaches him
karate and then PD says as a little as a
little boy like I want to be a comedian
so it's a point out real quick after his
fully formed karate training he says I
want to be a comedian uh yeah putting
that out there were hard right turn you
would have to regular Don Rickles
shut up
what was his initial joke
he was talking about that lady's ass
and it was very large
other than heckling the crowd
oh, he didn't have one
he didn't have any jokes
no
shut up
you shut the fuck up
he specifically, he specifically said I'm gonna take that lady's big tits and beat you with them
thank you, good night
thank you, good night
yeah well I think that's
that's the beauty routier a more and all
of his stuff is there's just like a
bluntness to the way he talks and he
says it like a constant yell I think
that's what you said way way back on
half from the bag an effervescent sort
of yelling concerned shadow
ugly old the movie is like he he goes to
LA because he has a comedy show mm-hmm
but Leroy and skillets also have a
comedy show and they think that nobody
in the entire LA area is going to have a
comedy show around the same time as them
it's 1970
I guess this is the dry season and so
they're gonna be the only game in town
yeah so they borrow big money from mr.
white investor of the century yeah our
losses have become the most dangerous
man in town dangerous for you guys it is
they really should have combined their forces
have petey open
or, or do his set
petey doesn't open for anybody
petey closes
what are you fucking talking about
talking about that band could only play
three notes
the one musician had to do double duty
if she sound like the trombone while
playing the keyboard on the keys it's
amazing it seemed like a variety show
where the head band and then they had
that would lady come out sing whose wig
flew off yeah whose Pippi Dee's scepter
made her wig fly off and her clothes fly
out but beautyberry he could have fit in
that lineup that was some comedy
stylings from PD we've started they
could have split the profits and it
would have been a win-win for everybody
that's true and we would have erased the
entire dramatic arc of the film that's
fine as long as Rudy ray Moore yelled at
people I wouldn't stop my show if you
needed ice water inhale so it's all for
the first you know what 20 minutes of
this movie it is kind of a light-hearted
comedy there's some kung fu' there's
some morality there's some sped up
footage Allah Benny Hill as he is people
try to strip his car and he beats him up
they're hideous you couldn't just run to
one side oh they're like this is gonna
be epic we have to shoot this in slow
motion
mostly our our wacky overweights comedy
promoters our vaudeville ask comedy
promoters Leroy and skillet Leroy and
skillet who by the way any time they
were on screen I was worried they were
gonna have a heart attack just right on
camera there they're very sweaty and I
was very concerned for them
I was worried their Poncho's we're gonna
split their pants throat wearing
extremely tight clothes yeah we do see
there there's some balls oh boy some
balls in this film hey I don't know if
that part of their pants was just all
elastic and how big that man's testicles
were I just could not believe it it
would look like he had a growth yeah
punchin balls they were my favorite
seventies cop team Hatchin ball Oh put a
little pressure on him he'll kill Leroy
I don't think
don't think
Leroy and skillet tell their, uh, their minions to rough them up a little
apparently, by roughing them up a little, it means beating the shit
out of one guy and accidentally shooting
his little brother
what you shot a kid you should have
expected that from this wacky comedy
come on Petey wheat straw is not gonna
be happening who's that guy
whoa oh that is indeed an accident
you see Willie Scarface kind of go, like, shit
and then they drive off and
then there's the very long death scene
with this young child
the scene is still going on here on this
and then we cut to the funeral
and for some reason again the rough them
up apparently means show up at the
funeral with a machine gun
oh no PD all this over a booking
misunderstanding PT PT wheat straw the
devil has has has made a deal with PT
wheat straw I will give you this magical
scepter
if you marry mutton marry my daughter
and produce an offspring yeah but what
happens when it when the devil shows him
the photograph here hope Beauty has
nothing to do with our proposition he
says oh hell no in one of the one of the
best moments yeah well that's the beauty
of Rudy ray Moore is the bluntness of
the way
I do legitimately like the the
simplicity of and you know they didn't
have a lot of money to work with
so like the way hell looks oh yeah oh
it's just like fancy couch and there's
like a phone next to it but it's all
with a red filter mm-hmm kind of like
the horns that they used
yeah the horns are fantastic they don't
look like nipples at all it's some
marshmallows and Elmer's glue
yeah
and then some devils had the fucked up faces
well those are those are the extreme
there's like different levels yeah it's
a video game yeah these are the more
extreme bosses
there's a whole, there's a whole world going on here
look, look
Rudy ray Moore, he wrote a lore for this film
and how he'll works
how demons work
man, i'd love to get a hold of that book
just like the similarion
it's like, he's just like Peter Jackson, with the Lord of the Rings films
oh, sure, yeah
he knows all the backstory
a producer once asked him, like, why do these demons have nipples, and these other ones don't
and he just goes, shut up
asked him like why do these demons have
nipples and why do these other ones
well, first off, the devil reverses everything that's happened
except the kid still dies
except that fucking kid's just fucked
the the gang that showed up with the with the machine gun don't realize that everybody's back to life
yeah they've already gone until Leon
Leroy and skillet that like killed him
all good we're gonna
great show and then they just show up
again
well PT wheat star shows up in disguise
it just looks like PT Rita sideways they
shouldn't have let him into that show no
I said there's something suspicious
going on you're gonna be suspicious
about this guy that looks exactly like
PD we'd stir you're gonna make it snow
in here I will pick both of them good
he should have led with with the
snowstorm but really he he made would
you know was a show snowstorm at first
yeah he made Leroy or skillet say say
offensive things to mr. White's lady yes
aka prostitutes and then singer comes
out and her wig flies off clothes fly
off and then he goes with the snowstorm
yeah I would have led with the snowstorm
we didn't realize it was a snowstorm at
first it looked like popcorn general
debris it felt like a like a Carrie
influence yeah when Kari starts there's
a lady outside who's going like this and
she's shivering okay that was after the
fact that was there the only thing that
could maybe make sense then yeah they
eventually everybody leaves and that's
the end of Leroy skillets show that's it
can we take a moment and look at prop
design what we need to do is look at PD
weeks cause Kane this isn't suggestive
enough now spray the manager counter
mostly your face please I think that was
supposed to be like a crystal ball tip
but I think it was yeah a ball of
tinfoil yeah and and typically that's
the top of like a wizard cane there are
many times in the movie where Rudy ray
Moore has it upside down and he's just
holding it like pointing in it thing
yeah and then he flips it the other way
and then sometimes he uses as a weapon
mm-hmm yeah so there's just a lot of
inconsistency listen the King can do a
lot of things the devil has many powers
well that's that's a really great
Morrie's like you know what this is a
goofy comedy movie in like the cane the
props don't really matter she's just
like fuck it just this is our prop
what what does matter
Rudy ray Moore hello obscenities at all
yeah the whole movies tongue-in-cheek
yeah you can't take the plot seriously
that's the thing is they know you can't
take it seriously
the majority of the movie they built up
this rivalry between the two comedy acts
yeah
so much, and then it's just over
that's the end of the second act
in the whole third act, it's PT trying to figure out how he's gonna get out of this shit
yeah because he's got a plan because the
otherwise he wouldn't have entered into
the bargain in the first place because
Petey wheatstraw is a clever motherfucker
we know it but so then like the last
third of the movie is how is PT gonna
weasel his way out of his obligations
yeah I want you to make a mass that
looks like me and we'll go and get a
wino
and we'll dope that sucker up not with wine but with the heavy shit
we'll put that mass on him and when Lou comes to pick me up we let him take him
fake fake mask on a wino never know that
this was years before the Mission
Impossible movie made realistic masks
cool again yeah
ahead of its time yes because when we
see the whales
but when we see the mass had literally a
head but when we see the mask off of
like not on the wino yet it's clearly
made of clay sculpting on a clay yeah
and it's just on a you know chunk of
wood or something and this also
reinforces the idea that winos aren't
real people that's true that's that's
the running thing is that PT weed straw
he's very moral you know he wants to do
good but fat people and winos are not
real people they don't they don't matter
yeah people that's one thing we actually
should stop and go back to because once
PT wheat straw has conquered oh yeah
Leroy and skillet once these cleansings
like cleared out of the problems he's
just a free man with a powerful cane
yeah and that's our montage that you
rightfully pointed out is similar to
Bruce Almighty Bruce Almighty is the
polar opposite where it's the devil
instead of God but it's still using
these supernatural powers to have a do
good montage yeah yeah it's just another
it's another case of white people
stealing black art it's more like Bruce
all whitey
take that Jim Carrey you psychopath
don't ever do it anymore
did you hear me
you hear me
with that, i'm gonna comb your nappy head for you
what
why is the other kid hitting him
cuz a grown-up is fondling his brother friend
what is he doing
oh, no
that's not your kid
he doesn't want it
he's so unkempt
from me drop the
sucker
PD lost me oh Jesus Christ
run away from that poor kid so up to
this point that's when the movie goes
full horror that's when we like demons
start showing up yes these demons and
Dracula cabe's well it's hard to say
it's horror when the demons show up for an orgy
that's why no Rudy ray Moore remembered
that there's no boobs in the movie so
far so you know what apart from the
swearing it's very pg-13 after that
point yeah it's weird compared to the
earlier movies and and Allah those those
great masterpieces that because PT we
try is just the best he fix those demons
into some comas yeah I guess yeah
they're stunned before we forget can we
talk about the one thing that will
potentially break the internet a lot of
graffiti featured in this VC that la
like late seventies thing right right
obviously you know stolen shots there's
no permits anymore clearly it's not it's
not production design new graffiti it's
real-life graffiti and during one of the
scenes I forget which well this is one
the the Devils the the demons are
fighting out in the in their Dracula
capes drag him to an alley and there's
just little Wayne that says lo Wayne the
famous rapper turned down for what and
we the first time we watched PD wheat
straw we googled this did Lil Wayne get
his name from PD wheat straw and we
found no results yeah so you're not help
us out we turned to you good people of
the internet or a little Wayne if you
happen to watch our video or a little
ways nothing yeah contact us yeah
I think I'm on the devil side with this
I think he should marry the gun deals
view he made a deal look at all the
trouble that he's caused you he's been
very reckless in you yeah Petey's been
dare I say little selfish yeah so back
in the mood there I'm
so very interested in the, in the hierarchy of
what
oh
I was telling you do it again, but you started talking
I was giving it a little more breath
you ruined it
oh, fuck
all right
i know the gag
well, okay
all right
let's start over, 
and now definitely don't do it
definitely don't do it, cuz, you know, rich Evans isn't here to, to
i forgot about rich evans
like, forgot that he's existed
yeah
okay
i did
I was like what's different
oh
it's a shame that he died
how many times
it's a shame that he'll never ever be in a video again
i know
i know
he passed on
he passed away and he'll never show up in a video ever again
it was a nice ad tasteful service yeah you know
not a lot of pomp and I know he would
have appreciated no remember when we all
gotten come down that was weird even
weirder was when it just reversed and
we're back and that's the unfortunate
thing is that he'll never ever be in a
video that we do ever again
rich richest ahead which is dead man
missing listen so it's very interested
in the hierarchy of actually magic are
there any other lyrics to that song is
it there's a telex you just you just I
guess you tonight strong over okay no
there's there's verses and shit
see how it fits they spend so much time
on him building this mask this mask on
the wino it's like 20 minutes of the
movie and then immediately the the wino
is in the car with these demons and he
peels off the mask and runs away and
that's the end of that they make such a
big deal about him being fat
yeah but then when he's in the car he
he's just Rudy ray Moore already ray
Moore's but he's not as fat as the guy
that they pick up on the street that's
like Yaphet Kotto fat okay look he looks
like y'all fat codes it is it's dark man
logic ok because that's what dark man
will put on a mask of somebody and then
ease immediately that weight and you can
talk in their voice it doesn't matter
see my question is that that that bit
where they have like the molded mask
right and they're like oh this is gonna
look just like you then they cut and
it's just him yeah it's just him is we
laughed you know because it's absurd
yeah in in context of the movie were
they like
that's the joke did they realize that
was so silly yeah I'm probably it's
probably I think they probably didn't
care jack disagrees is it self-aware
enough to where they they laugh and go
had that's funny
or were they thinking the audience
wouldn't believe it I think it borders
on the they didn't care line but I think
they were just going along with the
logic of the movie like here's the mask
we put the mask on and it it just looks
like it Darkman logic I really like that
examination and they if they say well it
doesn't look good and movie theaters are
blurry they won't really we're gonna be
doing coke doesn't matter seats no one
cares honestly I think it's more it
leans in more other than the other way
because when they're looking at they
find the first first fucking wino they find
it's like oh he's really felt
like yeah I know he's all guts and busts
but fine because I think this ladies all
got some buzz cuts in but yeah yeah and
just they take immediately it's like I
feel like they're aware of it as it
stands and I think it is more kind of
supposed to be a joke yeah oh you wasn't
my apartment must be a wreck bTW maybe
you should have married her now you got
to be sick a little leotards yes
the whole third act is where this all
takes over yeah when it's the you know
and then it culminates in that rooftop
fight between PD we'd start on the devil
yeah and the devil has really turned
into the Ernest Borgnine Devil's rain
kind of yes that's yeah full beard
disco disco red costume yes big ear cape
of course
cape
what the
oh my god
jesus christ
fucking what
threw a pile of burning laundry out the building
who would've thought the devil would be so easily defeatable
and he breaks the scepter
he does
he breaks the cane
which is not a smart thing to do
no
hang on to it just in case
well, i guess that, i guess that's him saying, like, i'm done with this
i have beaten the devil
I, I guess I've beaten the devil
I don't want this power
it's too, uh, uh, you know
corrupting
corrupting
oh
i don't think it was about his corrupting power
I just think he's like oh this will lead the devil back to me
and I'm a scumbag who backs away from my promises so I'm just gonna
this is like a tracking device
eh, fuck that
i don't know that that's, it's, it's
fuck that
vague
find someone else to fuck your ugly daughter
oh, yeah
it's over
it's over
he must have, that's my car
it's him
who
i killed the devil
he's dead
that's the spirit, my son
classic
oh
get in, petey
didn't think you'd ever see us again, huh, petey
oh, yeah, that's pretty ugly
the end
that's what he gets for trying to fuck with the devil
yeah
you can't beat the devil
you cannot beat the devil
I'm actually really happy with that ending
yeah
yeah
that's the shame is, like, I think we're nearing more we're
kind of done with the movie I guess
we're more in general I think is I would
have liked have seen it because I could
see that going on like you look at like
the the movies that came about in the
80s the the general like you know broad
comedies you have people like Richard
Pryor and stuff like that I could see
him like branching out and doing that
stuff and it never really happened with
him and it's a shame because I think
he's legitimately funny it would be very
strange to fit that kind of persona into
kind of a machine studio it would be
interesting imagine him like imagine
Rudy ray Moore showing up and like
coming to America sure yeah he would
work as like a bit player in that I'm
thinking of him as like Beverly Hills
Cop but would it work yeah yeah he's not
a terrific actor no it's it's a persona
he exists in these kind of movies in
these particular movies yeah and really
I think that's it
that's obviously not him
these white jobs I think that's what
makes him so unique is that like there
was no kind of like traditional movie
that would fit that persona so he just
made his own yes this made his own
really ruin that exists in his own world
and there the logic of those movies
where he could do whatever he wants
I'm gonna give them an opening that they
will never forget
