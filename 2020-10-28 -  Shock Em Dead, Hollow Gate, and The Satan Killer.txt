halloween
i oh all i taste is canada dry
it's not too bad now you want to try
yeah let me give a shot give it
a shot it says i'm not sure
it's not it's it's it's like a cookie
speaking of
dry and dull what's our first movie rich
shock him dead his first movie
and, you know what
fuck it
josh
you can read this shit
yeah, give me that
i think we all know what movie
you're describing today
we can lay the blame of each of these
movies on
the three of us that's true rich is
blameless
yeah that's why i'm passing the buck on
all of these motherfuckers
rich is, rich is often blameless
it's my fucking birthday
i'm not explaining the satan killer
i don't think any of us are explaining
the satan killer no we're gonna all have
to try
that was my pick i think i i'm gonna
have to tackle
you're gonna that tackle box if you need
help mike we're here
for you i'll do my best but first let's
talk about shock him dead
the whitest version of a black man song
you've ever heard in your life
this is the stock music footage of the
version of a jimi hendrix song
this is wonderful
no how the hell do they get their rights
to use purple haze
it's a cover yeah yeah but you still
have to pay for them it talks
that girl put a spell on me
uh so shocking that is about a fellow
that wants to be a rock and roll star
and does a terrible job auditioning for
a terrible band
so he decides that his only course of
action is to sell his soul to the voodoo
lady that's always wandering around
here comes a strange voodoo lady he
lives in that creepy old house on
thursday
magic
that's bullshit
it's walking past the pizza shop
ladies
that was not a sound effect i hope that
caught up properly that was great
oh my god beautiful
what the fuck is that
you mentioned the voodoo lady who
apparently spends all of her days
hanging out in front of a pizza place
well she's also got a house where she
changes into her evening time makeup
which is different from her day time
wandering around makeup
she's got connections with the devil or
whatever and uh
so this guy he turns into angel martin
uh the most badass guitarist singer
uh on the face of the earth he's only
got one
problem
oh great he can't eat food anymore
he has to eat souls instead what will
happen
are you gonna tell me what the fuck is
going on here angel you don't have a
soul
anymore he starts off a pervert to begin
with
right so it's it's this movie isn't
really a fall from grace
no he just turns into a different kind of asshole
he's, he's our bad guy
how can you be a big famous rock star
and get away with murdering someone
every day
once or twice yeah yeah that's happened
well this movie the problem with it is
that it's not incompetent the problem is
it's like it's it feels like the movie
is on ambien
like it's very kind of like slowly pay
it feels like the rough cut of a movie
before you tighten everything up yeah
it's shot very plainly like a tv like
seriously
yeah i mentioned it looks like melrose
placer or uh saved by the bell or
something
everybody's set mid-center a lot of
shots are
shot from medium or long far away that
really should have more close-ups do you
remember the one camera move
when we see before he becomes the rock
star when he's still the nerdy asshole
he lives in this trailer he
lives in a trailer and the camera
dollies for one shot to
show his trailer as the best character
of the movie comes in to yell at him oh
please stop it well
you're breaking my friggin heart right
huh how's this for a ride
wow you even dream you're famous you
better wake up and slap yourself
and with your amount of talent the only
line you're going to see is at the
unemployment office
all these characters are just full of
zingers i love this guy
creep he's great
yeah i wish the movie was about that guy
the trailer park man that guy and the
the pizza owner
he was also pretty cool what happened to
what happened to fuck you, tony, huh
but i wanted to really quickly cover the
premise
which is he sells his soul to the devil
essentially
a a faustian story
where he gets all of his dreams to come
true he's a nerd he wants to play guitar
he's terrible at it but
he gets granted three women that are his
his sex slaves or his servants
estates a palatial escape which is like
grandma's house
dressed up grandma has a water bed so
it's kind of in low budget land that
passes for a palacial estate he has a
very very
small like guest bedroom filled with a
bunch of guitars
no amps guitars that is his music room
you plug that into anything or that's
plugged in now
oh magic and uh
it looks like the set of three's company
because he's got that
the curved door and there's a little
step up it's a very 1970s
house somewhere in uh california
it's an ollie house and like three's
company you even have this one guy who's
humorously pretending to be gay
i don't go down on my knees
i'll wait till i'm married don't try to
touch me
please that was the mystery is like
okay is he supposed to be feminine to be
funny because they don't push it that
far
it's not like late 80s early 90s like
flamboyantly gay
it's not a super campy representation
but he's just kind of flirting with it
yeah but he's also writing songs about
virgin girls yes
but not in a very heavy metal way
we're trying to wonder is it supposed to
be funny is it a joke
is he supposed to be like just kind of
like a like a pansy-ish lead singer
who's not manly
not awesome like angel martin or is he
the sexuality never came up in terms of
the story
the impression i got is that whoever
whoever made this or wrote this
wasn't actually into glam rock and just
looking at it from the outside this is
how they see it
they go upstage and they wear that
makeup they must be
pansy boys put that in my script because
they're pansy boys directed by frank
sinatra
i'm going to make a movie that's going
to crush this genre of music
and bring back my music reveal them for
the sissies they are
oh he's taking us please
but even angel uh when he first becomes
a rocker
and he realizes he has this like bevy of
hot babes
he like the way he starts like groping
her boobs is very like clinical
it's not sexy no he's just like oh this
is the thing i can do now yeah
it's like it was written by uh either
just a completely out of touch
guy that doesn't understand the rock
lifestyle or uh
an eight-year-old boy yeah maybe both
one of each well hello
i'm marilyn you're cute you want to join
me
not right now they only ever showed us
the small wing of the house it was much
much bigger through one of those other
doors
maybe it was just like the it was just a
guest house and then
the whole estate was he just wanted to
dirty up the guest house that's
so small and shitty yeah you know you
don't want to clean all that you know
you move into a mansion it's a lot a lot
of square footage to take care of you
know
how disappointing i sold my soul for
this
i mean compared to his nasty trailer hey
he was upset about that trailer getting
emptied out
he went back to it to check on his stuff
yeah that was a weird scene
he goes back to his old trailer
the, the, the trailer park owner had, had removed all of his stuff from his trailer
which seemed to be 95% beer cans
it was yeah it was shit
so he goes and finds the the
the manager of the trailer park who's in
his boxers uh
watching porno and farting
what are you out of your mind
to everyone in this trailer park on your
damn tv
and then throws him on the bed and is
about to stab him
or shoot him or something stab him but
gets completely distracted by the porno
on the tv
oh does it usually happen with unplugged
tvs no
finds porno very offensive this is not
part of the rock and roll
that was the end of the scene so a guy
who sold his soul to the devil
to play hair metal rock and roll is
offended by pornography i'm not even
offended just distracted
maybe you just hated his particular
choice in porno
i disagree with you sir with the dildo
on the screwdriver
oh yeah
whatever the fuck it was
the uh, yeah
the drill 
it was, it was a dildo on a drill
i'm not gonna eat your soul you're a
perfert you're a pervert you were
looking through the fucking pepperoni pizza peephole
but pizza pie pe
it's called i got that we need to
trademark that name
pepperoni pizza pie people.com that's
our new website
someone's gonna buy that website i'm
gonna buy it right say it again jay
pepperoni pizza pie peephole.com.edu
it's it's cool while you learn to be a
pervert
when you go to the website that's all it
is is that that image
and you click on the ch it opens up and
it opens up you actually
and what's behind it is a disappointing
movie
is that the devil oh yeah it is oh my
god
oh my god he's a double neck guitar
can you play the guitar like that with
one hand he can
he's just like bending the notes there
oh, my god
holy shit, satan
this is pretty epic satan who is played
by what's his name
michelangelo battio you know his actual
name not even just the band name
yeah now from the from the band nitro
michelangelo barrio
the man that plays many guitars at once
as demonstrated in the freight train
video
from which a four-necked guitar descends
from the heavens
so he can play all of the necks um one
at a time
he had more arms yeah that's the only
way that would be impressive is if all
of a sudden two
more sets of arms came out that's all
that's holding them back they used to
play with his feet
michelangelo barrio not only is he the
hands of angel martin
uh in very obviously throughout this
movie
uh they're definitely every time there's
a performance from angel
uh the camera cuts about here and then
when we see angel's face he's doing the
exaggerated like
like this stuff so you remind me like a
like a like an old
like surfer b movie where it just cuts
to them and they're going like
it was like that yes
they were also kind of setting up
something that i knew was never going to
have a payoff but i
i thought there was going to be like the
potential for some kind of clever
loophole
like oh the contract says i can have
anything
all of my earthly desires i was i was
like waiting at all like you could do
something clever in here
i want something that comes from the
movie he's going to ask for something
that is actually impossible to break the
deal
cleverly save his soul yeah that
we all knew that was not going to happen
once he peeked through the
pepperoni pizza peephole at the poor
girl
changing we knew he wasn't going to be
our hero rich he was unlikable
yes yeah because he was he was terrible
at playing guitar it's not like he he
was
okay he's really bad it's not like marty
mcfly
auditioning you know power of love and
back to the future where he's pretty
good it's just too darn loud
i'm afraid you're just too darn loud i
was surprised by the huey lewis cameo in
this film though i was not expecting
that
he was walking in the background getting
to go into his car
what was somebody
that's another thing
our main fucking, uh, uh, wh-, angel, uh, can't even beat up an old man on his own
oh, that's right
no
because he's too weak and he went too
long without
him yeah they explain it because one of
the stupid one of his
ladies in his uh harem or whatever it is
what is it that tickets suck your buyers
they're just yeah they're just women
that serve him they're more sympathetic
than he is
five years ago i was severely burned in
a fire
i made a deal to be beautiful marilyn
was born deformed and she made the same
deal
was serving a nerd-turned rock star part
of their deal with the devil
yeah i know that's i was wondering that
when i was watching what were they doing
before that yeah
just hanging out yeah was servitude
to a rock star part of that deal maybe
it was
maybe they found that way to satan if
you make me beautiful
and let me service a former dork turn
rock god oh not let me no no no no no
that's where the tweaking
could come in sure sure because you
could take you could take
uh his name his first name is martin but
then when he becomes
the rock star god he says i'm angel
martin
that's his persona but in the beginning
yeah he he's
he's just stupid and he's a pervert
and he's untalented if he was like
trying and he was like you know
an underdog and then he becomes evil and
then he has the
he thinks that he's only he's only
recourse it's the only way i could i
could be what i want a famous rock star
is to make this deal with the devil oh
boy i really did something bad this is
awful how do i get out of it
yeah and it's actually i have to beat
the devil in a guitar duel
oh my god without the help of satan's
evil magic you should always write
80s b movies i swear to god you know i
talked to my dad this morning yeah
he said that you know if things don't
work out with this showcase or whatever
he can always use a hand grug
just one hand
look i've greg talent someday i'm gonna
be somebody
nothing is more important to me he
didn't even know the camera was rolling
he was an actor oh god okay so let's say
we we bounce in and out
of the storyline of angel martin right
this this nerdy
perverted pizza guy who who
who makes this deal with the devil but
we we spend an equal amount
of time on tracy lord's character what
do we do with her
right
yeah
we, we say, oh, shit, her, her parents didn't approve of her going into the music industry as a producer
yeah
she's just that they're just
nurturing this band and wants to bring
them to the top and
and she's failing and she's trying her
best there's the tiniest tint to that
whether where she's talking to the bass
player at the beginning
there's a lot of things you could do but
what they did do
didn't really work them that's the best
way to say it
i mean my brain my brain wants to fix
the movie
i know after it's been made and i think
that's actually a hallmark of a lot of
these movies
that sit in they're not so bad they're
baffling
like this is a confidently made movie
it's just not very good we know what
a lot of it's kind of dull it has a
couple little spikes here and there
we're like ah
what
like when angel vomits on that girl in
the front row of the concert
that whole sequence with him kicking the singer off
yeah
they could have cut to fucking credits right after that whole scene and i would have been satisfied
it would have been great
we can see where the good movie could
have been and we can
look at it and go oh if you change this
this and this this would be a good movie
or at least a decent movie as opposed to
swinging a miss
i don't see that in the satan killer not
in any way well that's
a whole different movie like another
conversation i'm going to have a whole
lot of questions about that when we get
there
we're going to come back another day and
shoot that discussion right we're going
to take a take a couple days off
are we going to analyze the movie with a
team of scientists
i need to meditate on it i really do
frame by frame analysis
yeah it's the zapruper film
film the whole thing the whole thing is
just
it's just the pooper films
this witch's brew is making me feel a
little funny uh-oh
well that's perfect jay because you'll
you'll need to feel funny when you
explain why you've made us watch hollow
gate
it's the only fucking movie we watched tonight that's a horror film and it's about halloween
and it was the worst come on it wasn't
that bad
it wasn't that bad but it was bad we had
a psycho killer
we it took place on halloween there were
jack-o-lanterns
left and right there was a theme of
wearing halloween costumes
the whole movie is about a guy wearing
halloween good movie
i hate halloween duh rich is
rich is condescending you i see that i
see that
i don't care i didn't think hollow gate
was that bad
it's a little dull but it wasn't that
bad a little dull
a little a little dull now
what do you get for winning apple bobbing
you get an apple
just, just a fucking apple
you get an apple
it's halloween
there's a whole bag of snickers
maybe there's a prize
oh, you're ruining that wig, kid
yeah
but he gets an apple well hollow gate
starts uh
i hit the seal you see i discovered yeah
you know
if i'm drinking don't you have to like
turn it or something yeah
yeah there's like a whole technique you
gotta turn it up back upright so that
there's still
air trapped under the like oh yes i'm
realizing that when i told you to drink
it with the toast for i was completely wrong
so jay, we're talking about hollow gate
tell us what, the what the fuck is the plot of hollow gate well hollow gate it
opens in 1972
or or 1990
some point in the distant not so distant
past definitely at least 10
no 12 years ago 12 years before where it
ends up
12 15 10 or 8 years ago we
there's a lot of time skipping in the
movie but it starts when uh
mark wahlberg is a small boy he's having
a halloween party
just as a clown he's dressed as a clown
there's there's bobbing for apples his
dad is very drunk
uh and and ruins halloween for everybody
for the rest of their lives come on get
in there what are you doing come on girl
can you know what kids are doing oh no
dad's strong
my god he takes apple bobbing very
seriously
i guess
where'd everybody go they left just this
is terrible
i hear you man his dad is very
disappointed because he's not bobbing
for apples good enough
yeah it's weird he has the attitude of
like uh like a
sport like a kid that plays sports like
baseball or something or
football like you got to be a winner but
it's about manly man unless you get
bob for apple yeah it's about popping
for apples it's really bizarre
and he just kind of breaks out of
nowhere too because he's very uh
concentrated on drinking when you first
meet the dad
he's angry he's straight up angry
drinking he's mad about the halloween
party but he's very focused on the booze
see i thought he was drinking he's angry
drinking because he's so pissed off that
his son is so bad at bobbing for apples
well we didn't know that because he
wasn't bopping he was drinking first
we saw him drinking he's always he was
rapping he was drinking during
the bottle for apples he probably
started when the group
started playing bobbing for apples yeah
because he knew what his fucking son, when it was his turn, that he'd just fuck it up
he's gonna fuck it up
he's gonna embarrass me
and it took a while
all the kids were laughing because he just couldn't get a fucking apple in his giant maw and he was [ __ ] up his
clown hair
born with a small mouth was born with
his mother's mouth
i told you never to interfere with me
and my son
and just how do you know that he is your
son
[ __ ] do you remember what the mom says
she's like if he's even your son
oh yeah yeah i'm like dang
jerry springer this is what we were
talking about it's similar to like rob
zombies halloween where everyone's just
like horrible white trash um
so yeah the kid almost drowns because
his possible dad
tries to drown him in the the apple
bobby because he's shitty and
popping for apples yeah and then we cut
to 10 years later where he's suddenly
35 years old i'm sorry i i didn't mean
to scare you
working at a gas station in the best
scene in the movie yeah this is where
he's had his most sympathetic well we
cut to our
so he's not sympathetic but his dad is
drowning him for
big bad not as much as that's he [ __ ]
sucked at bobbing for apples he's
but it turns out he's good at sitting
outside the gas station waiting for a
fornicating couple to pull up
yeah well yeah we hold on that couple
for a while to the point where i thought
they were going to be characters
we get the like the preamble or the
pre-story of them having sex
on a blanket next to their car in a
field
no don't do it not not for hollow gate
right to the edge you're disgracing
princesses all over the world
wonderland would be so disappointed only
on film
and they talk about johnny yes uh mark
wahlberg mark wahlberg uh who who works
at the gas station and how he's a loser
and they're gonna go
to the gas station just a buck
specifically to make fun of him
on the way to the halloween party let's
just go to halloween no let's stop at
the gas station and make fun of mark
wahlberg
because we got time we got time there's
always time to make fun of mark we had
sex until the sun went down
and now let's go to the gas station and
make fun of poor mark wahlberg
there's not a lot going on in this small
town in utah apparently not
in 1982 or 1994 or whatever year it is
10 years later 10 years there's a lot
going on in utah 10 years later it was
definitely 10 years later i can tell you
that much
let's make fun of that kid who aged 35
years in the last 10.
you know that'll happen get you get
bullied you age real fast yeah
yeah yeah i'm living proof
and i guess i don't know how this is
some like form of insulting him but he
like
the the guy in the car like gives mark
like here's his girlfriend
if it makes sense if it was like a girl
he liked yeah but it's just
like i'm [ __ ] the girl you like but
it's just some woman
uh but it leads to the best part of the
movie
is he going to use her [ __ ] panties
to blow up the car oh i hope so it's the
wick to the guest
that's great that is there as they drive
off this car is blowing up
yes and i'm all about that yes do it do
it
i love that now see that's yes that is
we can all understand
mark's emotions at that point and then
the movie ended
that's a runny thieving night where it's
like all three of these movies the
credits could have come
at any any moment we'd be like that was
great
may i have a fire department please oh
no it's not an emergency
by the way happy halloween
what why
this looks like a commercial like a
lawyer commercial excuse me your honor
have you ever murdered somebody at
halloween
two years apart from your previous
murder that's something you ever used a
woman's panties to blow up a car
i can help believe me your honor
if this were your daughter you'd do
exactly the same thing counselor
you don't have to tell me how our system
works
bill do you have anything to say
and then we have the all-important
lawyers scene which we
we talked through let's not let's not
let's not all of us act like we actually
watched that scene
we talked through the entirety of it why
would you watch that scene because it
was there i guess
i don't think we missed any vital
information by not painting
that's all it was was vital information
and yet we didn't miss a thing
i i think i understood the rest of the
movie in context
once we finally got to see uh mark
again when he's under the care of his
grandmother
in a locked in a room he's now 30 or 47
or 92 or 29. if that lawyer seemed
important at all we wouldn't have needed
the exposition cops to come in later
just tell us everything so when do i get
this scoop on that old recluse in there
that's right you haven't heard about old
granny
i think the lawyers gave us the same
exposition as the exposition cops
mark was now he was he was considered
crazy
um that maybe he spent some time in a
mental
uh hospital but he was under the care of
his grandmother
we didn't get any indication that that
time passed
whereas previously we had there was no
ten years later and then we didn't get
any of that so it might have been a week
we don't have about a week could have
been a year could have been five years
he's living with granny now
he's supposedly medicated he's taking
his medication we have to reveal that
he's not taking his medication
is that all you old [ __ ] want
happy halloween you filthy old
hag he's so cool
oh crap ever did was believe in you you
dick but then the rest of the movie you
know we focus on the scooby gang they're
going to uh
oh god a halloween rock show out of the
hangar
you know i really think i could live on
submarine sandwiches
and beer man they get they got all the
way into oklahoma and they want to have
some subs and some coronas
they want beer but they go to a
convenience store that happens to serve
food
it's the first place they can stop to
get beer thanks a lot al we all enjoyed
the beer and
sandwiches and stuff they just happen in
place yes you can get beer but they
happen to be serving bombers
they're very excited about the
sandwiches hey
look guys a costume shop
it's nine over there
it makes you look so wicked look i'd
love to but the thing's nine bucks
oh come on i don't have nine bucks spend
it all in submarine sandwiches
then we just left there when we saw this
halloween show
i wanted to get wasted at the sub shop
basically everyone dies because she
wanted a sparkly wig
yes yes it's all true it's all you know
a lot of the times uh horror movies like
this it all hinges on one little thing
somebody wanted a dollar store wig did i
hear you say you were on your way to the
hangar
yeah that's right actually i have this
delivery i need made out at hologate
hollow gate right it's in a state about
five miles off of highway 47 we're going
to end up at that house
which they're going to end up at that
house the rest of the phone
i think they're having a very large
party tonight they've ordered a dozen
costumes
and my delivery boy he didn't come in
so what do you have in mind are you
[ __ ] stupid
mark wahlberg aka
mark wahlberg uh didn't take his pills
which it allowed him to stab his granny
yeah now
he's got full control of his his actual
palatial estate
yes yeah this is a much better house
he didn't even have to sell his soul
with the devil no apparently you just
inherited it from from nana
after he's dabbing his gorgeous mansion
uh the hollow gate with the fence and
everything
mark decides to order 10 halloween
costumes 12
12 from which we see three of which we
only see
from rip taylor actually i have this
delivery i need made out at hollow gate
right taylor jr rip taylor it's early
rip taylor he's he's young
he's before he discovered glitter yeah
it's rip taylor and he's working at a
costume shop right
and and before the scooby-doo gang
shows up what would have happened was
rip taylor would have delivered the 12
costumes to him
and all would have been done well no
rick taylor wouldn't have delivered him
that was the whole
uh he couldn't leave he couldn't leave
the store and that's yeah
he's like hey my employee didn't show up
for work can you complete strangers
deliver these costumes to mark wallace
so again it's happenstance it's like
it's like an re-astro film just like
whoops looked what happened
yeah it just happened since exactly so
he didn't have some
maniacal plan to wear different
halloween costumes while killing
teenagers no he thought it would just be
fun apparently
but it just turns it turns out there are
some teenagers to kill so i guess you
might as well
but why did he order the halloween
costumes then because it's halloween
well he'd order them under the pretext
of a party
nano was going to invite people to the
house
that's why he stabbed her today no i
yeah it's in there
i think the script is assuming that mark
wahlberg is some kind of mastermind
who just knew that four kids would be
showing up in oklahoma to drink
across the street from the costume place
where they would get distracted by a
shiny wig
where the shop owner would have to ask
them specifically to drop off the
costumes at his house
that was a sinister plot and another
assumption is that these teenagers were
out of money and they couldn't afford
the six
six or nine dollar wig yeah apparently
apparently uh mark wahlberg knew that
these kids weren't loaded
yeah if if nerd with glasses had enough
money to buy that wig
everything would have been fine if velma
would not have had the desire for the
wig in the first place
if they had not stopped for beers yeah
it's halloween boys and girls so what do
you say
we have ourselves a party
because then the rest of the movie they
show up with the costumes and then
mark wahlberg uh wears different
costumes as he kills them off one by one
they can't get out of his estate because
it's an electrified fence
so they they wander around and he kills
them one at a time is there any more
witches who left
there's a lot left mike drank it all no
there's a ton of them no there's
actually quite a bill
well like three quarters oh gosh that's
pretty good
the witches are pleased we honor the
witches please
we honor the witches with the with the
with the drugstore vodka
i got it i got it the big problem with
this movie
and because the first uh 45 minutes or
so
there's lots of like halloween imagery
and halloween you know decorations and
it feels very halloweeny
and then they get to the mansion and
then it's yeah it's just lots of
stalking around his mansion
suddenly he's walking around in like
combat gear
yeah it's not established yet that he's
going to be wearing different
costumes to kill these kids so the first
thing he's wearing is like army fatigue
yeah and he's like dropping racial slurs
the books are out happy halloween
i mean if the gimmick is because he
ordered a bunch of costumes is it going
to be like every kill he's a different
costume like a different character that
would be
that'd be kind of interesting that'd be
okay so maybe that's
maybe that's the thing we haven't gotten
to it quite yet we're an hour into the
movie
before you get to the chasing and all
the that stuff
you really drag it out and you you
shrink up the chasing to make it more
exciting
this way immediately they run out of the
house and the chasing
is the rest of the movie is the rest of
the movie and and this
flip opposite of exactly what they
should have done yeah
how to fix these movies
how do you fix this [ __ ] oh yeah
exactly we have that series rich it's
called best of the worst
it's like one of those like home
renovation shows on the like the
the tlc yeah you want this we got to
knock out this wall
no we're going to point the whole thing
it's okay we're going to make this an
open concept we're gonna move the
laundry room here
we're gonna still have to have that
that's that's a load bearing it's okay
but we'll
now much better in short quick
bursts this 30-minute segment where
she's running through the woods
that's got to go that's we got to take
that out we got to know who these
characters are
that's your foundation of the house
that's you know you can't build a candle
house without a foundation
well there is a really weird scene i
think you were out of the room this is
after the first guy dies
happy halloween he gets stabbed and then
he gets the axe in the back of his head
yes
and his girlfriend oh yeah hold on here
oh the crying scene
he's got this whole monologue one shot
uh it goes on for like 10 minutes
he just told me the night we were going
to do it
he did and i saw her
he said we would
how many times i've had sex did you see
him
did you see him yeah he got a hatchet in
the back of his head
it was [ __ ] gross yeah and she's just
giving this whole monologue where she's
recollecting how they met
how many times they've had sex and it
goes on
it was so cool i know it ended around
and that was the fourth time
yeah she gets really specific and the
first time that we were gonna do it
he told me and i knew i was just trying
to figure out why that was in there if
it was like the director was
the actress went to the director and was
like i i want to have
an emotional scene to show off my acting
like all i do on this movie is
she cried about all the times
the actress was talking about how many
times she had sex yeah
sure this wasn't the tracy lords feeling
no
why are you laughing why why does this
guy keep laughing
he thinks you're funny he thinks you're
a clown you're a clown am i clown to you
oh my [ __ ] make you laugh am i some
kind of clown
i'm good fellas 1990. 1990 that's the
same year as shock him dead
oh my god they're the same movie they're
so they're both so good
martin scorsese
i passed on shock i'm dead because i
wanted to do good thoughts
you know biggest regret of my life is
i was really into hair metal
hey listen for someone who did that much
coke in the 70s he probably was
that's why he passed it to his good
friend sinatra
that's a direction frank's trying to
make a career move he's trying to change
what the time is
he's going to direct this hair metal
picture that he's going to come out with
a hair metal record
oh my god frank why does my character
talk with the list because you're one of
those hand metal guys
you know how they are you're all [ __ ]
you know
you're one of those how do you guys do
this thing
you shake your hips or what
how tight do these pants gotta be
oh there's the very slow tractor kill
that
needed a bear trap desperately never as
a movie needed a bear trap more
right he's he's very slowly coming
towards her it's like that awesome power
scene
i was thinking of that we were watching
it yeah watch out
watch out i want to i want like the
fargo
wood chipper kind of like it needs to
start like splashing up in the window
and you see his face the other side
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you set that up
with the it needs the pov shot
from the mower yeah you got to get
closer and going over
yeah yeah yeah it's the lots of options
that this movie does completely wrong
with this scene here that's that from
the top
first you need a bad trap she can't get
away
but whatever that's you have him dressed
like a farmer not a
cowboy and i think when they first show
the costume there's like a little
sheriff's badge
yeah it's weird he should have come out
on a horse
and had a lasso and you know threw it
around her neck
there's so many creative things you
could do with the costumes that they
just did
who's making these decisions uh who was
frank grizzo is that his name the
director's name dino de rizzo or
something like yeah or was this was this
was the one that was like steve calamari
or is that this one no it's
that one it's like something calamari
it's like uh
dino d rizzo i think it is dino de rizo
it was dino de laurentiis oh
he corrected this film oh he he knows
how to direct the movie this is why
ah the fox is about this leads to
the scene that saved the film oh this
scene is brilliant this went a long way
in brightening our mood it's the scene
that saved that scene
are we ready
their golden retrievers aren't the kind
of dogs that tear you apart
no they they have cuddles yeah
come on they're just excited retrievers
this is what they got
in the words retrievers like they
retrieved
he got lumped to death
his golf cart hit a pumpkin oh my god
they they tried to get to german
shepherds
dormam and pinchers they tried yeah you
name it they and they
they're oh well they're all booked up
for this weekend too
we got two golden retrievers yeah go
ahead
they were booked for a dog food
commercial but now they're free
and they retrieved some hugs i could i
could imagine the actors like showing up
that day
not knowing it was going to be golden
retrievers are you [ __ ] are you
serious are you [ __ ] kidding me
they're in these like these like flimsy
cages i got my grandma's dogs
what if he had like like a hundred
pomeranians
yeah a thousand pomeranians that's the
title just a thousand pomeranians
they all have the bloodlust just like
the
scene in gremlins where they're all
coming down the street
one pomeranian is cute but a thousand
and then there's the yeah it's like the
darkness outside the front door one
appears
and then two oh that's cute he closed
the door really quick and then the door
in the house
they start jumping through the glass
windows
just start like pouring through the fire
fireplace
this is the next rlm feature film guys
there's so many of them they can't stop
them they just
have two thousand pomeranians
that's the title a thousand pomegranates
a thousand pomegranates
a night of a thousand bomber the night
yeah yeah yeah okay
all right coming soon to nowhere near
you
yeah maybe that's the problem is that
they're not deadly or anything they're
just very annoying
non-stop extremely annoying lure them
off a cliff at the end or something
deal with the pomeranian problem wait
they keep trying to jump up on the
person's lap
until it collapses their lives should
they put like grandma like a crane
and then just like move the crane
hold up it just attractive to a grandma
i can't believe that old woman is having
a party geez
and from what you tell me about that
lady and that kid
i'm with you i don't think it was the
old granny that was having the party
why well it wasn't her the call
wasn't no we have to logically
spell out how the cop is an excruciating
detail
this film was not a box office hit this
i'm not sure this film went to a box
office mike it played in a box office
somewhere somebody's vhs tv
a homeless man's office
it was the cardboard box office head of
the year
oh that's the stuff it's on skid row
it's los angeles i see i see
the vhs tape moved from cardboard box to
cardboard box and skid row and somehow
ended up here
no one wanted it so they gave it to us
no i don't have a vcr because i'm
homeless
press it on to the next box i just like
to set it on my shelf pretend it's good
i just look at it for a while i hope
it's a good movie
it's a hit in my box
i hate halloween it's dumb
and stop talking about a hollow gate
that angers the witches
we want to please the witches oh no no
oh no
oh no
good work mike good work yeah it was
like john ham
peeing
because he has a big yeah
he has a notoriously large notoriously
it's an interesting uh you know words
the alcohol is taking effect
i didn't know anything about this it's a
thing okay
speaking of john hamm's balls
would you would you like to tell
everybody about the satan killer
i would love to which is the weirdest
[ __ ] halloween movie i've ever seen
yeah this isn't really a horror film no
uh
okay
cop cop in present day
cop with beard or beard stubble or
makeup to appear
to look like they're on the scene yeah
the the plot of this episode you
describing it it's gonna sound like
darmok the cop
with yellow shirt bloodsteam
detective stevens do you think there
could have been anything done to prevent
this
i could have caught him does that mean
satan killer sees women in bikini
yates from tub old grizzled cop
squeeze the balls don't make me walk you
around
child in strip club i'll come home
when i'm ready embarrassed
embarrassed
well i still think you should see a
doctor
yeah the hell with that at least bump me
full of radiation and drugs and tell me
i need my tonsils out
well maybe you do need your tonsils out
well maybe
oh boy okay we're going to start from
the very top
i'm going to try it here okay so cop cop
has beard stubble
he is drunk he is mourning the death of
his wife
he has a yellow shirt when his wife
wasn't alive his shirt was
red they they had a great time
until the satan killer which is man
on a motorcycle who was once a small boy
whose mother was a stripper who worked
at slammers
i'll come home when i'm ready he murders
drunk detective's wife so basically you
have these two characters
and their conflict throughout that's
really the only through line we had
through the whole movie yeah that's the
other that's the only thing we had to
cling to
because all sorts of stuff happens and
we've so many things happen
we don't know either immediately in
the time or ever how it relates
those are [ __ ] chaps josh mike
who just happens to be wearing jean mike
all chaps are assless
i guess yeah okay yeah you're right but
there's not wearing them where'd they go
they flew off so fast
it's got a different motorcycle now oh
god the traps flew off is this the same
guys
there's a lot going on here yeah a lot
of a lot of stuff thrown at us
someone's watching a film
this movie is exhausting already it's
fitting a lot in
all these films of us at action park
so so she yeah she died of uh an
unrelated uh
incident action part he's just sad about
it she got beheaded by a
water slide he blamed it on the satan
killer
that's the thing when we start this
movie the tempo of it is just
it's cutting back and forth in time and
place who's who
what's what we have no idea inundating
with ideas because the way you do a
flashback right the guy
goes to this restaurant where him and
his wife were at
right and then you have him sit down and
he has a drink and then you you
you bring up the sad music you move in
slowly and
drinks then goes whoosh washes off the
camera
fuzzy soft echoey echoey music starts
with a
soft piano they have a loving
conversation and then
sir certain would you like would you
like another drink oh yes yes yes ma'am
but really it's just it's just hard cuts
of random edits
as opposed to lady in pool lady blow
drying her hair
news report guy watching home movies
it's like anxiety-inducing
yeah confusion inducing confusion
inducing definitely yeah
and it's doubly confusing because our
drunk detective is clearly following
leads
but we have no idea where he's getting
these leads
is he following his leads appear to be
from just randomly asking people
questions on this one strip
and they also have newport news they all
happen to completely coincidentally
people who know something
three locations there's the candy shop
there sells pizza and then there's the
strip club
yeah uh or a bar i don't know if they're
at the same place or not
but oh and then there's uh there's
applebee's so though no
uh two uh uh
two dads and oh my three sons
which is you guys a girl in a pizza
place yeah yeah
yes my three sons which is some kind of
store
which is next door to the candy factory
or whatever it is so
he he drunkenly goes into each of the
three places and demands to know
that's the important part drunkenly
where is it going the dock it's going to
the
where do you get the first clue let's
let him on those like what clue into a
what what series of clues did he get to
lead him on this trail
is he on the trail he's just wandering i
was getting snacks
he's knowing he's going to buy my three
sons videos is he just randomly hoping
to run into the satan killer
i don't know oh he's threatening
somebody somewhere else oh he's
roughing some guy up at the beach
outfitters
he's just this is he's just shopping now
he's just going about his day
and i love i honestly i love the way
it's shot because it seems like it's
like two floors up across the road
you see him like stumbling it's like
this footage where someone's just
filming out their window and like look
at that [ __ ] drunk guy
and then all of a sudden he's shoving
someone on the street and punching
next door he's drunkenly wandering in
and out of touristy shops
we're done with that now whatever that
was we're done
did the script just like say detective
dan
does cop things yes script
and they just filmed from like a hotel
room oh my god
oh he slept on a park punch maybe we
would go home still wearing the yellow
shirt well yes
i woke up out of the beach
pan across the beach oh god i'm still a
cop in this movie
i'm still drunk
a coffee shop yep five days
no i don't think i should be reassigned
you've been through too much to be
rational
oh he's not officially off the case
apparently not he's got other cases
i'm not being taken off this case and
he's drunkenly on the satan killer case
got it and his name is jim or stephen
this is like shane black's first script
he's gone now didn't know what he was
doing yet
he wrote
remember when he went to the airport why
oh yeah they went to the airport for
five seconds
no i'm sorry i don't understand stanford
what was he doing at the [ __ ] airport
what's your name [ __ ]
he's here to take out this pimp i am so
in the weeds
he's just gonna shoot the punks now no
they're fine
who's this guy what was at the airport
he just shot a pimp he was just walking
through an alley it's just like hey
guess what
bam and just moved on while a couple of
punks walked
like look at that he figured the pimp
might know something
and the pimp's like i don't know nothing
i'm just smacking up my hoe
and then he's like die pimp and then
moves on and
scene we forgot about the coffee shop oh
we're just not there yet
well he i'm saying he calls into the
station at the coffee shop and he says
i'm i'm drunk it's been five days
they're off the case mcgarnical but no
i'm not buy
heads up this decides he's not
yeah that's all it takes it's like in
virginia apparently that's yeah
i'm still gonna investigate these these
satanic murders
it's it's a cop movie and that's a
standard cop scene like
i'm taking you off the case detective
brannigan
you're getting too involved but the
thing is they tried to take they tried
to take the cop off the case and he's
like no i'm not off the case
all right you're not off the case then
that's fine okay
so like we still have to do that scene
for some reason we're explaining it's so
simple
cop wants to find killer because killer
killed his wife
well that's basically it basically
that's that's reporter nosey reporter
won't leave him alone
they go on the adventure together and
get closer and fall in love
but instead of that he teams up with
ball cop
i'm gonna grab this sucker by the ball
save it
hey what are you doing oh he's spreading
it oh
yeah he's see that alone i just got one
more question
what's a [ __ ] have for breakfast
yes that you asked out of everybody for
some reason
open your [ __ ] mouth oh my god
we we should talk about ball cop a
little bit though bow ball
because knock yourself out jade his
first appearance
is the elderly parents of young lady
we think it's the one who got yanked out
yeah there's
there's four girls in a hot tub and they
say we would like some drinks
also food also we would like to some
food
let's get something to drink let's get
something to eat and drink
are there places that sell both thanks a
lot al we all enjoyed the beer and
sandwiches and stuff
what if you go to the drink store and
i'll go to the eat
store and i'll stay here because it's my
birthday it's her birthday
satan's minion or satan's killer he just
walks up from outside
adjacent to the property the thing is i
honestly if they plant it as a comedy
it's a it's a really good gag shot where
it's just like
here he comes but then he grabs her by
the hair and he pulls her out of the hot
tub
it's a great shirt it's kind of spooky
and scary because it looks like she's
lifted up by her hair
and i don't know how they did it i
you're gonna have to they lifted her up
by her [ __ ] hair
maybe yeah but then we we cut to
an elderly couple and and then uh yeah
stanley and his wife
bald cop guy he's like he's just a
beautiful young lady it's a shame
and i think it's the same girl and he's
like i'll find their killer
toothpicks kill 30 000 people a year and
then two hours later
bald cop is still at their house
drinking and he's like i'm still gonna
get this guy
i'm gonna start at the strip club well
the weird thing is this is after
spending so much time with drunk cob
and drunk cop is like oh yeah it's his
mission to find
the satan killer but then we cut through
another couple of exact same motivations
have you seen that ugly [ __ ]
yeah and we're like
what why are we being introduced to the
same storyline with a different
character because drunk detective
couldn't get it done jake yeah drunk
he was so motivated by personal revenge
ball cop is motivated by money and the
uncontrollable desire to squeeze people
by their bolts
that is it that is it that is the text
on the back of the box
okay i'll be right back that's great
i've got one hell of a thirst
for balls do you have any cheese balls
is the movie over oh no it's just a
commercial break
hey i've been listening to you all night
and there's a nuke oh my god they're
multiplying
oh [ __ ] wait six years in today
huh you gotta be [ __ ] crazy you can
come along
what he said he said that's the same bar
oh balls it's not a different bar why
did it [ __ ] fade to blast because
they introduced a new actor
what did you do over there artillery
i was a male nurse no
[ __ ]
well it's it's weird because it's like
okay he
you know you we're gonna team you up
with a partner and that's your you know
that's a pretty standard cop movie thing
too
except drunk cop is too random and
wandering away to have a partner
yeah two loose cannons yeah and then in
addition to that then we team them up
with
a male nurse yep
did he [ __ ] you away more than once
let's pay back i'm listening
now he's teaming up with that guy it's
like eight guys versus one squad where's
that third one what happened to the
other car
what's
yeah now they have the address of the
satan killer because you squeeze the
balls of some guy in a bar
it's the police version of a pyramid
scheme
now we know exactly where my satan
friend's gonna be
when he's gonna be there wow they
squeeze some balls rich
balls till we found out squeeze balls
until you get the information you want
your random balls yes
you squeeze enough balls somebody's
gonna know what you're
what you're what information you're
looking for so they're teaming them up
with multiple people throughout the
movie
for five minutes for five minutes and
then they yeah and then they all die at
once
an hour into the film that [ __ ] scene
you set me up
oh my god
every character
they died him up he's the second skiller
was at the boat dock
only drunk detective is left look that
guy's dead
balls cop is dead both guns got shot
like you could have introduced like
the cults and there could have been like
a giant shootout with all of these
people at the end
nope no everyone just dies at the pier
the way the movie just
resets itself there is actually fairly
audacious
where the [ __ ] are you gonna go
unintentionally you have to say
unintentionally audacious this isn't
like uh like like a david fincher
thriller where they go and zigzag in
directions you don't expect
unintentionally audacious is the kindest
thing anybody could possibly say about
this movie
it's honestly more that they don't know
what to do with all of the rest of the
characters
so they just go ahead and kill them yeah
they introduce characters
realize that there was like a backspace
button in the like
ms word
i can't just go back and erase that
scene they wrote it on a typewriter
what's white out i can't
satan's killer look and a limo i don't
want that jerk on my ass
anymore i'm sick of playing games with
him
this is kind of funny i pay you to
protect me and you can't handle as one
dude
if you want me to do my job get him
off my ass who was that uh
was that supposed to be a reveal like oh
he's working with that guy
i am well if you want more plot we get
more plot when we discover that the
satan killer is working for the mob
yeah why was that i don't know he only
does for one scene and then it's never
mentioned again yeah
i think this mob's just like a side
thing he's a serial killer
but he also on the side does protection
work for the mob
okay so why did three people die for
eating leftover pizza
drunk cop shows up at this hotel i
my think can't handle it this movie's
asking a lot to me
it really is a third movie
oh better take my machine gun out there
eating leftover pizza
and it has nothing to do with the satan
killer no he just wanted to save his
pizza
oh my god why
and what because they ate his pizza
and pizza but that wasn't his hotel room
or his house
why was he there because it was his
pizza
he's coming to get it
no this is the limit of our
professionalism
i've reached the precipice i can't take
any more
all of our our years of training have
led to this
why do they go to a hotel when drunk cop
has a home well then why was there a cup
also
at the hotel they're not supposed to go
to drunk cop's house they're supposed to
go
to meet with the mob and drunk cop just
happens to
walk by this hotel room hear them in
here and even though he doesn't know
what's going on with the plot to kill
him
decides to open the door and just
randomly immediately
shoot these people immediately shoot
these people anyway and just by a happy
coincidence they were people that were
recently hired to kill him
is that what you were telling me yes
thanks
i killed three guys today they were
eating pizza in a hotel room
i don't even know why i was there
the movie kind of makes up for it at the
end
oh yeah we have an amazing shootout yeah
this movie once this movie [ __ ] gets
in the fifth gear
this is a case of yeah blazes it
blazes but it takes forever to [ __ ]
get there it's from zero to 60 in an
hour and
five
zero to five in an hour and 25 minutes
and then five to sixty yeah yeah if you
took the end
of blood debts and bumped it back half
an hour yeah
that's what we got yeah yeah
oh run down bill the cameraman doesn't
know what to vote i don't know
where'd the movie go we lost it
don't fall off make a break for it
cameraman
save yourself don't touch that thing
damn it
oh goddamn those kids playing with
cherry bombs again
you're wearing white shirts yeah demon
i was a demon cop drunk up
no no killing the killer satan killer
has what looks like a tommy gun
it's like it's like a tommy shotgun it's
a but it has a
a circular casing that has shotgun
shells in it yeah and he
blows the lady like a college girl's
guts out
yeah she's just trying to get on the
elevator he blows up the [ __ ] when
exposition cops finally show up in the
movie yeah he blows up their car
oh what
oh my god the toy car blew up where was
that
it was the exposition comes from the
other movies oh
they showed up for a second and got
killed in their car
their car turned into a toy car
all the cops start showing up all of the
cops
there's helicopters there's swat teams
there's [ __ ] ninja [ __ ] suckers
all sorts of [ __ ] going on all sorts of
[ __ ] going on everybody shows up
no listen there's not a whole lot going
on in virginia i guess they're not
they're all going to show up
it's like the end of the blues brothers
only instead of the blues mobile falling
apart it's the movie
nobody can stop save this killer
oh no just do it what's one more piece
you're just gonna shoot her anyway
what's one more body come on not on the
tomato products
after all this buildup you feel like
there's got to be a huge [ __ ] like
like you want to be up on the on the
roof of the garage you want to be like
he's going to be right by the edge of
the
of the [ __ ] structure he's gonna go
falling off you want a hans gruber
ending
and and he just dies next to a a
rack of flour in the kitchen
like a piece of plastic music
this music is perfect
all those cops there and it's
hey over for a movie with such an
engaging story it was very anticlimactic
yes that's right they built up to this
ending
like when he's walking into the the
ambulance at the end like yeah like the
satan killer should have popped back up
covered in blood
but then but then out of nowhere like
ball cops like in the wheelchair
for breakfast not this time
i know what you're having for breakfast
my [ __ ]
oh that's a satisfactory ending rich we
certainly could not get that from this
movie
a little die hard with carl carl winslow
finally firing a gun again at a perp
mustering that courage again that is
what die hard was missing karl winslow
needed to grab more balls
this guy we're looking for is a
scum-sucking [ __ ] ball biting
death machine
yeah and there he is now
it's just a kind
i just worked for con ed i mean is it
too much to ask
to have something make sense
something that's like a good quote for
the box
it's the critic blurb on the front of
success so what did we learn today
uh we learned that halloween is
cancelled
from now and forever so i i i guess
we'll start from from
from you jay what what is your pick for
best of the worst best of the worst
you know well you know what i'm going to
say and everybody's going to hate me my
best of the worst
is going to be hollow gate because one
it's actually halloween themed so uh
satan killer was frustrating and
annoying mike what's your vote that
definitely isn't hollow
i know i know i'm in the minority here
that's fine
jay i i i totally respect your decision
do you no i do okay okay jay i have
absolutely no respect for your position
i i do in a strange way i do you're
right
it is halloween themed and
uh whatever you said
but never dumb [ __ ] you said i don't
[ __ ] care
i gotta go with the satan killer because
it's it's on that demon cop level of
bafflement the end shootout is amazing
but up until then it was incredibly
annoying and frustrating it was
frustrating but it was
funner than the other two josh um
well i'm gonna vote for shock i'm dead
because i feel like i need to balance
because they're all bad and if i feel if
if i felt comfortable abstaining
pressure on rich oh oh there's no
pressure but
there it is there's a balance here
between all three of these movies that
rich don't care
well [ __ ] you guys i'm i'm going with
the satan killer
oh look look [ __ ]
[ __ ] you can't keep ball you can't
beat ball cop
and that insane shootout you know what
we need to point out and this is
something we haven't mentioned yet
what makes uh satan killer make a lot
more sense we looked up
the director on imdb even though this is
the only movie he's ever done
he does have a picture on imdb
and when you see it you see that picture
and you're like
okay now i understand the satan killer
that's the guy that made the satan
killer yeah it's headshot on imdb
looks like he went to sears where they
had like the discount photography
and he wasn't happy about it and he just
like sat down he's been in hard times
he's been like homeless for the last
eight months
and he's trying to get a decent head
shot so he can get work so
he cleaned up as best he could and he
went to sears but he's a director why
does he need a
he's a director he's behind the camera
but sears only gave him like like
four seconds what's the audition and
they took oh god maybe behind the camera
you look like a director go ahead
he got the serious photography package
that lasts four seconds
and he was able to sit in the chair and
there was like motion blur
or you said you said it looked like a
mug
shot it kind of looks like it's like
it's the split between a mug shot and a
school portrait
is that anyone's is anyone's imdb
picture a mug shot like he's actually a
mug shot
should be
oh my god
well a happy birthday to you and a happy
halloween
to everybody else that's disgustingly
wholesome
cheers
have we have we satisfied the witches
or whatever we're doing i don't know jay
we'll find out
well i haven't drank anything is that
bad
probably we are
indeed offended what
you have consecrated our sacred
burial ground and
upon us send these men
corona virus
