Rich: Hello. This is Best of the Worst episode 46, subsection: Wheel of the Worst episode 13A. I am Rich Evans and this is Mike Stoklasa
Mike: Hello, Rich.
Rich: Hello, Mike.
M: Jinx.
R: What?
M: We both spoke at the same time
R: So what?
M: Is this the time when we attach terrible, random video cassettes to a wooden wheel?
R: No, this is not the time to attach the video cassettes to the wheel, as you can plainly see, they are already attached to the wheel
M: I understand--
R: This is the time in which we say the names of the tape, and then spin the wheel
M: To randomly select a terrible VHS cassette to watch
R: Correct
M: Where we record ourselves watching it, for the amusement of others
R: Incorrect
[Mike laughs with a deep voice] (???)
[Pause]
R: [In an animated voice] Hey! So what’s on the Wheel today, Mike?
M: Well, the first film I see, that we’re gonna start with is called, uh, Get Street Smart: A Kid’s Guide to Strangers...Dangers
R: Featuring a sea monkey
M: It’s an helix(?)
R: Yeah, yeah, it’s an helix(?)
M: Although, apparently his name is “Corny.” “Learn with Corny how to avoid kidnappers.” I guess they called him “Corny” uh--c--maybe ’cause you’re supposed to think of Corky, from Life Goes On?
R: That’s exactly what you’re supposed to think of, our next tape--[Starts turning the Wheel, then stops] What what what?
M: There’s a little subsection 
R: Oh my god
M: “Also features a special parent segment, with Cindy Williams. Plus, the ‘Get Street Smart’ music video”
R: Cindy Williams
M: Ok, uh, it--this is a film by Sean McNamara, it’s important that that’s noted
R: That’s great ‘cause we’re not gonna land on this we’re spending like 15 minutes talking--
M: Alright!
R: Fucking great our next tape is: Safe-Crossing: An “Egg-cellent” Idea! “A school bus safety video for classroom use, with K 3 students”
M: Ohh, here’s the best part: 10 minutes long
R: Yaaay!
M: This is--uh, this is a tutorial on how to get your egg across the street safely? And look, that child is about to get run over by the bus
R: I hope he gets--I just want to see him get run over by the bus. That’s the only reason this is on the Wheel…’cause I’m hoping a child gets run over by a bus, because we are horrible people
M: Well, that’s fair
R: What’s--what’s next?
M: Uh, next is called...Nightmare on Drug Street?...Which, I’m assuming, came out in the 80s, to rip off the popularity of Nightmare on Elm Street. Uhh, very clearly an anti-drug video, “fight drug abuse, educate your kids now!”
R: And--and these kids are all dead! Looking at the bottom here. They have years associated with them so that’s good
M: Yeah, uh, um...which...we were discussing earlier if those are actual people, that may have died of drug overdoses or if they’re just actors playing characters?
R: I think it’s gonna be actors playing character--”don’t do what I have done”
Man from the video: The point is...we’re supposed to figure out where we went wrong
Jill: I know where: dope
[Rich Evans Correct-o-meter is written at the bottom of the screen]
R: Yeah. That’s what it’s gonna be
M: Uh, it’s…[Starts ripping off the tape]
R: Rip it off, just rip it off what do you got, what do you got? What do we got? That sounded too good
[Rich helps, but Mike sticks it back on]
M: Here, I got it
R: What--You just fucking--
M: [Indicates the side of the tape] It’s made by Twin Tower Productions
R: Oh my god, this is gonna be a disaster!
M: Ok, what’s next, Rich?
R: How come we can’t get away from 9/11?
M: I don’t know
R: I’m just shocked there’s not an AIDS video on this Wheel
M: The next video’s called “AIDS video”
R: “AIDS-mazing Things...To Make And Do. Dr. Misterio’s ‘patented’ video almanac of fun,” and that’s “patented” in quotes?
M: [Chuckles] So it’s not really patented?
R: I think he just wrote his ideas in a piece of paper and shoved it into like, a drawer at his house that he has labeled “patents”
M: Uhh, this is volume 2
R: Volume 2, so there’s a lot of these, so these are the shitty ones
M: This is the less amazing--
R: This is the shitty, less amazing things that didn’t make volume 1 [Reading the caption] “Here’s an all-new kind of video you’ll want to watch again and again. Let Dr. Misterio and his friends show you some truly Amazing Things.” That’s great
M: Hopefully it’s not his penis [Rich doesn’t respond] Now, do you think this is gonna be an animated film, or is it gonna be a live action thing with--
R: No, it’s gonna be a live action thing...and...it’s gonna be, like, magic tricks done with, like, a creepy camera and you just see his hands and you never see his face? [Footage of hands folding a dollar bill is shown, the Rich Evans Correct-o-Meter dings again] “Here’s how you make a coin disappear”
M: Would the sound be--dgggrrrgggrrrrrrgrgr [Rumbling sound (?)] [Moving onto the next video] Uhh [Sighs] “The Best of Just Kidding. Rude pranks and dirty gags.” And this man, his wife just died
R: But that’s hysterical
M: Uh or maybe his son got hit by a school bus
R: [Chuckles] You tied it all together, Mike. I love it
M: I assume he’s laughing, but, it looks like he’s doing the “nooo”--like, I’m gonna get you? (???)
R: Khaaaaaann
M: Yeah, he’s doing the Khan yell. So, this--this--”the most hysterical gags and practical jokes ever caught on video,” looks like hidden camera stuff
R: Yeah
M: Probably like, Candid Candid Camera? But just without the creepy rape stuff in it
R: Like--like fake stuff, do you think?
M: I think it’s just gonna be like...like, “we filmed these people in a shopping mall...put a c--dollar on the ground and pull it with a string,” like, like, shit like that
R: Yeah
M: It’s, the way the box looks, it’s--
R: Shitty?
M: Like it’s marketed for children...or very infantile adults
R: Fuck--fuck that I hope we don’t land on it. Uh, next we have...Travelling with Ooga Booga
[Silence]
M: Yeah, and two people in blackface? With a child. I don’t--uh--I don’t know--what--on trains, trucks, and airplanes?
R: This--this sounds like, like a children’s video made by the Ku Klux Klan
M: They clearly had the ability to print their box label in color? But yet, their little picture’s in black and white. I--I--ee--is that because these two people ARE in fucking brownface--or blackface and--
R: Oh god, I hope not
M: And they just thought, like last minute “oh shit this could look really bad”
R: I’m going to assume their faces are green? And they’re just very cheaply done aliens
[A green alien lady speaks, the Rich Evans Correct-o-Meter dings a third time]
M: They have a little, like, prosthetic on their forehead that looks like a Klingon...like forehead?
R: Yeah
M: So I think they’re supposed to be aliens, but, uh….
R: I hope they’re aliens
M: I really don’t know. Oh! There’s a guy here, I didn’t even notice that!
R: Yeah, yeah, there’s a little furry guy 
M: Like the cowardly lion, almost 
R: We got, just a--Captain Caveman 
M: Okay, so I think they’re gonna be aliens...they’re--maybe they’re distant cousins of this guy [Points to Corny] They’re ALL about telling kids how to be safe
R:.....What are next?
M: Next we have...Bear Attacks. Uhh...Bear Attacks, Stoney-Wolf Productions and--
R: We don’t need to read anything else on the box, because there’s THIS image [Points to an image of a man with blood covering his head]
M: Yeah...it looks like it’s from Dawn of the Dead
R: That’s the only thing that matters, is that image
M: I assume, this is going--they should have, like a subtext or how to survive bear attacks?
R: Maybe it’s just completely gratuitous, like “we’re going to show you bear attacks”
M: It’s kind of like that video we watched, where they’re shooting gophers?
R: Exploding Varmints?
M: It’s gonna be like that, just, uh...really gruesome…
R: Just people getting mauled by bears..for an hour. I’m down. I’m down with that
M: Me too
[There’s a still of a blond guy with sunglasses sitting in a field with a bear in the background, “HIM TOO!!!” is written over it]
R: Our final tape is, How To Spot Counterfeit Beanie Babies…’cause Beanie Babies were a thing...25 years ago
M: They were very popular among grandmas. Uh...this video is produced by SEI(?) Incorporated and Trendmasters, is not sponsored or endorsed by Ty company
R So they’re a counterfeit themselves?
M: A counterfeit video on how to spot counterfeit Beanie Babies
R: That sounds great
M: It does, Rich...none of these sound great
R: What are next?
M: Well, that’s it
R: Oh my god
M: And now is time to spin the Wheel of the Worst
R: Oh my god, allright, am I gonna spin this shit?
M: Well we have to readjust our camera angles
R: Do we have to…? Okay
M: This is the part where we cut, I don’t know if you’ve done this before
R: I just wanna spin the Wheel--

[9:25] [Lands on Stranger Dangers]
R: Oh no...Stranger Dangers
*7 minutes ago*
R: That’s great ‘cause we’re not gonna land on this

[10:06] JK: “Uh, yeah, I play pedophile number 18..”.
J: “...try to fuck an alien kid”

[11:07] M: What?....Get off the screen

[11:33] J: Well, Josh, let’s try and be like Cindy Williams and forget that ever happens
Josh: What happens?

[12:18] J: [Talking about the little boy] That’s her husband

[12:45] JK: The way the shots are composed, and the editing, it’s like, it’s like a--a….Wes Anderson-directed film
M: Yeah, yeah, it’s very avant-garde

[13:57] [Jack spins the Wheel, lands on Travelling with Ooga Booga]
JK: OOGA BOOGA!!!
R: Oh great, vaguely racist tape, here we come, I think...god, I hope they’re supposed to be aliens

[14:26] M: This looks like a porno. A sick, sick porno

[14:51] JH: Fucking...asshole kid.

[15:30] M: I’m all on board for Bear Attacks. I think it’s gonna be amazing
J: I’m there
M: “This is a disaster”
JH: No, you gotta act more like you’re pulling (???) out of your nose…”disaster”
M: “Disaster”
JH: “We got the best videos, we got the best bear attacks”
M: “I’m very proud of the Bear Attacks tape”
JH: “Everybody knows we got the best bear attacks”
M: Now it’s turned into, uh...Christopher Walken

[16:15] [Jack spins the Wheel]
JK: Ooh, that felt good...felt good
[Lands on an undesired tape]
R: No, it didn’t 

[16:28] [Rich is showing Jack how to spin the Wheel properly]
R: Here’s what you do, here’s what you do, grab it by the side…
JK Yeah
R: And then--no no no, don’t grab it by this, you’re gonna rip the nails out, grab it by the--grab it by the side, like a man, Jack! Get a grip on the Wheel!
JK: I’m a weak man!
R: You gotta grip on the Wheel, then you--then you go up
JK: Yeah
R: Then, and then woo!
[Lands on another undesired tape]
M: Keep going, keep going. Don’t spin it--
[Rich grabs the bottom of the Wheel and spins it again, finally lands on Bear Attacks]

[17:39] [At the table, every tape is laid out]
JH: Uh, we kind of went off the rails, today...we had to watch, uh, for various reasons….[Looks at the camera] Everything on the Wheel
J: This is the final Wheel of the Worst episode ever 

[18:19] J: Stranger Dangers is a...it’s a reimagining of Groundhog Day...you just replace Bill Murray with a...very, very stupid alien, uh, and you replace Punxsutawney with, uh, Rapetown
JH: It was Molestville

[19:48] R: Oh my god, he ate that poor fish 
JH: His dad’s a voice in his head
R: Zarconians are monsters!
JK: Hey, not all Zarconians
JH: Oh jeez…

[20:35] J: The difference is, he has some weird, uh...like--like, sex toy bed? Where he wakes up and his bed sheets are just vibrating
JH: (???)
M: He’s just furiously masturbating each morning 
J: Yeah
M: Knowing that the possibility exists that someone could try and kidnap him
JH: To be fair--
M: He knows...that a quadruple-double-anal possibility exists...which is just called an octa-anal, in his--from his...planet...and he’s just hoping for the day
JK: That’s eight
M: Yeah
[Jack makes a confused face and stares at the camera]
J: His name is Corny, have we even mentioned that, we just started calling him Corny
JH: Yeah, it’s short for Cornucopia
J: It’s short for Eight-corny-holeys…?
R: [In the background] Corn holes!
J: That’s what I just said!

[22:17] JK: Possibly one of the most well-established characters...in the Corny Universe...is the--The “Slow Burn” Molester
JH: He’s always there, he’s puttin’ in the work
J: Can you imagine that actor going home after the audition that day, like when he finds out he got the role, like to his wife, or whoever, I mean, I get that, like...a child molester, who is targeting an alien idiot
JK: But--but not just any child molester, the main child molester
J: The main child molester
JH: In a town full of child molesters, the main child molester is someone to be reckoned with, Jack

[23:20] JK: “Now I’m gonna get that sweet alien ass!”

[23:27] [A woman comes to Corny’s rescue]
Woman: What’s the matter? Who is this man?!
J: “I want to molest that kid!”

[23:55] J: But they also establish earlier that, uh, when you’re in a situation, listen to your heart. And if it’s someone that you know and that you’re friends with and you listen to your heart, you’re gonna let them in
JH: Yup
J: So you’re fucked no matter what. No matter what, the results end in being molested
JH: That’s what happens to Corny…..Uh, so the next video--

[26:41] R:...that creepy closeup of him, I expect to hear, like, flames and screaming in the background

[28:50] JK: Per--perhaps it doesn’t take place in Rapeville, but more in like, the general Kidnap County?
J: It’s a broad region

[32:38] M: Uh, Nightmare on Drug Street…[Picks up the tape] uh, okay, we got about four minutes into this...because, uhhh, fuck...fuck it, uh…[Jay and Jack burst into laughter] I don’t even want to talk--I have nothing--ok, it started off--
J: The very first line was funny. Where we see the lineup of the kids, and we--we very slowly, like, dolly in on them--
JH: …these chairs
J: Yeah, and they were in purgatory or whatever, and the one kid’s like “hey, wassup, I’m dead”
M: No, that was the girl who said that. She was like “hi, I--I’m...I’m Jill”
JH: No, she said “hi, I’m dead”
Jill: Hi, I’m dead
J: “Hi, I’m dead”
M: You said it like the black kid said it
*13 seconds ago*
J: “Hey, wassup, I’m dead”
M: You really did…
J: I think you’re making implications here…
M: Rich….I’m like “what?”
JH: No, no...
R: He clearly sounded like Latino to me

[35:08] [There is a car crash, Rich is lying on the sofa, staring blankly at the TV]

[36:00] JK: Oh no, Space Cop is closing in
J: Space Cop looks better than this
M: It’s a (???) compliment

[38:41] JK: And genuinely, when you watch a prank, kind of the funny part of that is the amazing...crazy reaction that the prankee receives after the prank happens…
JH: You don’t see that
JK: This is a montage of people looking very confused

[42:21] M: [Whispers to Rich] Only six minutes have gone by

[42:48] JK: Basically, this episode is a series of failed executive decisions

[45:39] M:  We had to shut it off because it was...unbearable

[45:50] Narrator: The subject of bear attacks has the potential to mislead the public into thinking that every bear is a killer. That is simply not true
M: [Laughs] No, it is
Narrator: Far from being dangerous…
R: Why don’t you go up to him and find out?

[46:06] JH: But the point is, after failure after failure after failure after failure after failure after failure, finally we arrived…
JK: Hehehe
M: Which is also a failure
JH: At the...
J: To the ultimate failure!
JH: The treasure failure of the night, How to Spot Counterfeit Beanie Babies [Everyone laughs] This...is...15 minutes of a...fella with a moustache and grey hair talking to Becky and Becky and Vicky about how you can counterfeit...Beanie Babies?

[47:19] JH: We are on public access, right?

[47:30] J: “Why would they waste their time on such an inconsequential thing?”

[47:42] M: Rich, you were into Beanie Babies, right?
R: No
M: I remember [Rich shakes his head] Like, in high school?
R: No
[Silence]
M: Yeah. You used to save them, collect them
R: Now you’re just fucking with me
M: No…..I would not say anything like this...in front of a camera. It’s embarrassing. You know it’s true!
JK: I know Mike well, he would never say anything defamatory
M: Thank you, Jack

[49:11] JH: I just noticed at the bottom of this--at the bottom of this video…”limited edition box”
[Mike rolls his eyes and covers his face, Jay and Jack point at the tape]
J: Like the case for the tape?
JH: THIS! FUCKING! TAPE! WAS COLLECTIBLE! Oh my god!!
M: Now you hate it
J: Do you think at one point, that was worth $5000?
JH: No!

[51:01] J: I think any--anything is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it

[51:44] J: How to--How to Spot Counterfeit Beanie Babies feels like it’s coming from a very sincere place

[52:07] M: Your passion plea for How to Spot Counterfeit Beanie Babies sure sounds like your pick for best of the worst
JH: Oh no, it’s the egg one

[54:39] JK:...and I’m 80% sure that the actor in there is a voice actor from Invader Zim
M: None of those guys ever said…”horny for Corny.” Never once. ‘Cause I sure was

[55:41] M: What happens in the bushes, stays in the bushes
J: Exactly
M: Is what Corny always said to me
JH: I appreciate even though he’s getting raped in one of his four buttholes that he kept safe by having a condom

[56:11] J: He’s not real...he’s not real, so it’s ok
JH: Yeah, Molestville is not a town...as far as I know
JK: What do you mean?
M: Jack had already booked his vacation

[56:52] R: Is that next to Pedo Falls?

[57:38] [They use the tapes as bowling pins and destroy them with a bowling ball]
M: Well we’ve got six VHS tapes set up like bowling pins, and I’ve got a bowling ball. Guess what happens next...

[58:10] J: Let’s bowl, let’s bowl, let’s rock ‘n roll
(...)
M: Fuck! You almost hit the camera!

[58:38] [Mike drops a bowling ball about a dozen feet onto a stack of tapes]
