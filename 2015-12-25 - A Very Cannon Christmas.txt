Hey, Josh.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, Merry Christmas to you, Rich.
How are you?
I’m doing great.
So what are we doing this fine holiday season?
Oh, well, look at all these presents we’ve got under the tree here.
Oh, presents under the tree.
That sounds exciting.
Yeah, did you see the tree?
See how we decorated the tree?
No, where, where, where’s the tree?
It’s right here.
What do you mean?
It’s right here.
No, it’s not.
Yeah, it’s right here.
No.
Yeah, look, it’s right here.
What?
It’s right here.
What?
It’s right here.
Oh.
Last one on the lot, huh?
It’s the size of my heart.
Hmm.
So what’s the gimmick?
So the deal is, so we got two big options in all these presents under the tree.
One of them is Christmas specials.
The other option is Cannon Movie classics.
Action films that make you proud to be an American, or something.
That sounds fucking awesome.
Right? 
Nothing--
It’s gonna be fun.
Nothing says Merry Christmas like Charles Bronson with a .45.
Okay, so half of these are Cannon films...
Mm-hmm.
...and the other half are, like, Christmas stuff?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right, so what’s--
Total luck of the draw.
What’s, what’s the metagame here?
Because I really, I really want a Cannon action film.
Mm-hmm.
Then, we got this little oddball thing here.
Yeah.
I don’t know.
That doesn’t really looks like it’s gonna be a DVD.
Well, maybe it’s probably just a DVD, but it’s not, like, the full case.
It's not a VHS tape.
It cannot be a VHS tape.
I can say that much.
Cannon film, I’m gonna say is a VHS tape.
I like the way you're thinking.
So I’m gonna, I’m gonna open one of these bigger guys.
Hmm.
No.
This one.
We're going with this one.
That looks good.
All right.
I like the way you think, Rich.
Oh, no.
There’s, there’s another layer to this mystery.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Death Wish 3!
Yes!
Great start!
It’s the best Christmas ever.
Great start!
I was wrong about the VHS, but I got my, I got my Cannon action film.
It worked out.
All right.
Did you get your wish? 
I got my Christmas gift.
Thank you, Santa.
No, "wish."
Wish?
Death Wish.
Oh...
"He’s Judge, Jury, and Executioner!"
That’s the whole point of all this, of the whole series, I thought.
"If he can’t find justice, he’ll make his own."
Is it, is it clear he’s a vigilante?
I, hmm...
Is it clear?
Hmm.
"Paul Kersey doesn’t seek out violence.
"It just seems to find him."
Ooh, yeah.
"But when it does, he’s not about to back down."
"Charles Bronson brings out the heavy artillery in this guns-blazing, no-holds-barred thriller!"
"Road-worn and battle-weary, Kersey longs to leave his fighting days behind him, but when he arrives in New York to visit an old friend..."
Who probably gets murdered and raped.
Yeah.
"He finds him brutally attacked and gasping for breath in a pool of blood."
"Now, the silent avenger must wage war once more on the city’s punks--"
Only once more.
"And hoodlums."
Only once more.
"This time, he brought a small arsenal of guns, knives, and even a bazooka to help him!"
Special features: original theatrical trailer.
Ooh.
So...
Good.
They went all-out on this release.
They didn’t include a menu?
So you can pick the chapters?
No, but the sound is mono.
Ahh, that’s special.
Yeah.
That’s special.
So you want to, you want to be able to hear every little, uh, uh, gunshot...
In, in, in...
Crystal clear mono.
Focus, focus.
They don’t want you distracted with sounds coming from your left or right.
That’s confusing bullshit.
Exactly.
This is straight, straight at you like Charles Bronson, just, uh, to the point.
Yes, blow the car up.
Oh, everything in the trunk fell out.
"No!"
Really?
"Oh, he hit me, ohhh!"
"An elderly man just punched me!"
"It's the creep that stole my pocketbook three weeks ago!"
"Yay, murder!"
"We love it!"
"We never thought to murder anyone before!"
That’s just, that’s fucking nuts.
Just everybody's out the window.
Yay!
Hello, I am also wearing a Spock t-shirt.
I see we’re doing the presents thing again.
Now remember, Mike, half of these are Christmas movies, and half of 'em--
Ehh, whatever.
Let’s open this one.
I get it, I get it.
This isn’t my first rodeo.
The fuck, really?
Another thing to open?
Make some more sco--
Don’t got all day here.
Don’t you?
I do, actually.
The Christmas Tree.
Oh, that’s an original title.
Oh.
Is it telling that the first thing I look for is the running time?
Eh, no, that, that, that, uh, uh, wh- what is it?
245 minutes.
Oh, fuck my life.
Collectible Classics:The Christmas Tree featuring cartoon characters I do not recognize, but look like a ripoff of the Whoville haracters, right?
"The poor children who live in Mrs. Malvida’s orphanage...
Hmm.
"...have never had Christmas presents."
"hey’ve never even heard of Santa."
Well.
Ts sounds like it’s gonna be a blast.
"The cold hearted Mrs. Malvida doesn’t believe in such foolishness.
Ok, I’m with her.
I’m with her.
Yeah, I agree with her.
Yeah.
I’m gonna, I''m gonna relate to her character the most.
Yeah.
Um, "the cold hearted--"
Oh, I read that.
Uh, "despite their hardships, the hopeful tykes still find reason to celebrate beneath the branches of a stately pine tree that grows just outside their window."
What?
I guess that’s their Christmas tree?
There’s a tree outside.
They have to shiver in the cold.
Yeah.
"When an energetic young moth--"
Moth?
Oh, I’m sorry.
There’s, it’s a hyphenated, it’s a...
Oh.
What you call that when you format text to fit, like, in the newspaper?
Uh, justify.
Justify, thanks.
"When an energetic young moth and her two adorable children come to work in the orphanage, the ragamuffin tots hope for a real Christmas!
"But not if Mrs. Malvid has anything to say about it."
She doesn’t want Christmas, she doesn’t like, she’s a scrooge, without saying she’s Scrooge.
Right.
Cuz it’s copywritten.
No, it’s not, it’s really old
Oh yeah.
That’s Charles Dickenson.
Yeah.
Charles Dickens?
Janice Dickens.
Janice Dickens?
Yes.
Jane Eyre?
Yeah.
The Jane Error of Her Ways Was Writing--?
Oh, god.
"If Mulvida has anything to say about it, will she actually chop down the children..."
Wh-, oh.
What?
"Will she actually chop down the children’s beloved tree?"
Oh.
I’m, I’m looking at the name of the production company.
Flamarion Ferreira Films.
Oh, yeah.
It sounds foreign.
Huh, great.
Region coded?
Oh?
Oh, thank God.
Seriously?
Yeah, region coded....ALA?
Oh, it says all.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Let’s go watch The Christmas Tree.
Fine.
"Oh, you."
"We've come from the mayor's."
"I know, I know."
"The mayor just called."
"I'd better go now."
"Take good care of yourself and the children."
"I will be back before Christmas."
"Don't worry, Ray."
"We'll be just fine."
Those dead eyes.
Yeah.
"This is going to be your bedroom."
"I want you to make sure you have your feet cleaned, so you won't dirty your sheets."
Everyone just looks miserable.
"...or nothing!"
"Are you crazy?"
"Mevilda!"
"That's right, Mevilda, now you're cooking with g--"
What?
It's, it's just the cutoff.
"Now you're cooking with g--"
Hey, Josh.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Jay.
Where’s your Spock shirt?
You know this is our first Christmas without Leonard.
Wasn’t Leonard Nimoy Jewish?
Yep!
So do you want to pick out a movie?
Sure.
Remember, half of 'em are Christmas movies--
Yeah, I know.
It was my idea.
Oh.
I’m gonna open this one
Okay.
That looks like a movie.
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.
But which one is it?
I don’t know.
It’s the best--
Chuck Norris in Invasion U.S.A.
"The best of Chuck Norris."
I’m guessing, I’m guessing that was a very short-lived series of DVD's.
Um...
All right.
A Joseph Zito film, who we all remember as the director of the best Friday the 13th sequel.
That’s right.
Uh, "America wasn’t ready, but he was."
Oh, Richard Lynch is in this, too.
That's great.
Okay.
"When America faces invasion for the first time in history, it’s up to one-man army Matt Hunter..."
That’s a very, uh, appropriate last name.
Mm-hmm.
"...(Action star Chuck Norris)..."
That’s right.
"...to wage war upon the enemies of freedom."
"On suburban streets, in shopping malls, and even in churches!"
What?
"The firepower explodes in megaton fury, death-defying stunts, escalate..."
Is this even English?
I don't know.
This is very choppy.
Uh.
"...and death-defying stunts escalate into a heart-stopping climax when Hunter, America’s doomsday weapon..."
What?
He's our doomsday weapon?
Apparently, he’s the doomsday weapon.
"Launches his final plan: a ragtag army of terrorist mercenaries led by Soviet agent Rostov (Richard Lynch) catches America unprepared and makes it a war zone from sea to shining sea."
"Only one man can stem the..."
They, he’s gotta fight the terrorists. 
So it’s--
I get it.
So it’s--
I get it.
Yeah.
It’s Chuck Norris versus the terrorists.
Right.
It’s Red--
There’s like, there’s like five more sentences.
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.
I’m done.
So it’s, it’s, it’s Red Dawn meets Dr. Strangelove?
Well, who’s better at fighting an army of Russians: a bunch of little kids, or one Chuck Norris?
I think we’re gonna find out.
All right.
But, uh, it’s Chuck Norris.
It’s Chuck Norris.
Spoilers.
Okay.
He’s a one-man doomsday machine.
Yeah.
Is Lea Thompson a one-man doomsday machine?
The, no.
I don’t think so.
Chuck Norris also never tried to fuck a duck.
"I only do what he tells me to."
"What the hell is going on?"
"If you come back in here, I’m gonna hit you with so many rights, you’re gonna beg for a left."
"Oh, yeah?"
"It sounded better in my head."
I'm sorry.
"Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."
Seriously, it was at 25.
It already exploded.
"Lose this?"
Ah, it was up at 30 again.
Fuck you.
He’s like the Bugs Bunny of action heroes.
Are we okay, space-wise?
I think so.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well...
I could, I could stand to be a little less wide.
It's team maroon over here.
Sweatshirt on.
Well, there's not much maroon, cuz you got that fucking grey shirt.
Well, that's because it's fucking cold.
I know, but you're ruining the motif.
It's a motif.
It was a motif.
But now it's not a motif.
That word has lost all meaning.
You said it too many times in a row.
Motif?
Motif.
Motif motif.
Motif?
Eh, it means something to me.
You need to say it a little bit more than that.
All right, so today we watched, uh, what we did was we went ahead and did the presents thing again, cuz it's fun.
We enjoyed it.
It's Christmastime.
It is.
And in Christmastime, you open presents, and they may not be the way you expected.
Sometimes you get a lump of coal.
"Come here and see Mrs. Hopewell."
So, first we watched Death Wish 3.
Classic Jimmy Paige-scored Death Wish 3.
Jay.
Yes?
Would you like to tell us about Death Wish 3?
Uh, Death Wish 3 stars Charles Bronson as Death Wish.
Yes.
He, uh, all of his family has been raped and killed at this point.
We’re the third movie in. They're all raped to death.
Mm.
Uh, his wife, his daughter, um, his maid...
Yeah
Uh, his mother.
Oh.
Uh, the dog.
Everybody’s been raped, so now he goes...
Somebody raped his toupee, too?
Uh, so he travels back to New York, cuz everybody's gone, and he goes to visit an old friend...
"Election time, Charlie!"
"Election time."
Oh...
Right when he arrives, his best friend, that we've never heard of before in the first two Death Wish movies gets killed.
"Paul, take care of my things, will you?"
Just get right into it.
Um.
And he decides to take back the streets on this one block radius from these, these thugs, these movie thugs.
Mm-hmm.
And that's what they are. 
They're not real thugs.
These are movie thugs.
They're creeps.
They're creeps.
"Truth is, I hate creeps, too."
"Creeps killing creeps."
"Six creeps shot."
"Chief, creep--"
"...creeps on the street."
"Creeps."
"Creep."
"I've had enough of you creeps."
"It's the creep!"
"Creeps."
And then the rest of the movie is just a non-stop orgy of violence...
...and, and, uh, shooting...
...and Home Alone-style traps, but much more violent."
Are they much more violent than Home Alone traps, or is it just the consequences are much more realistic than they were portrayed in Home Alone?
That's true, yeah.
"What are those?"
"Teeth."
In, in Home Alone, Home Alone starring Macaulay Culkin...
Rich, Rich has a crush on you.
You don’t--
He wants to be home alone with you.
Oh.
Oh, no.
So, gang members in the post-apocalyptic future of 1985.
That's the whole movie, yeah.
It looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but it's just, uh, 1980's New York City.
Like, two square blocks of Lower East Side.
Mm-hmm.
"Who are you?"
"I was Charlie's friend."
It looks like an amusement park, the way the people are, like, the extras are...
Yeah.
...like, layered.
Looks like people wandering around Six Flags.
It's a little over-the-top.
The movie is a cartoon.
The movie is a complete cartoon, complete with, I don't know if Michael Winter, the director, had, like, ADHD or something, but he's just, like, every five seconds, he's cutting to a bizarre new angle.
Yeah.
Or, he's like, "I'm bored with this scene, it's just people talking, just film it through his elbow."
It looks like a movie.
Yeah.
Except for the fact that, I think it’s supposed to be widescreen, and we watched the 4:3 open matte, so, lots of headroom.
"We lived a few blocks from here."
"Charlie was 19 feet tall."
No boom mics, though.
No booms.
A lot of booms.
But no boom mics.
Look, the way, the way to describe the movie is just, it's blatant.
It pays lip service to having some kind of story, like the love interest.
Fake, fake love interest who, suddenly, it's a romance.
She has a thing for older men, I guess.
It's a romance because she has to--
Much older men.
Because she has to die, so Charles Bronson can have even more motivation.
Yeah.
After all of his friends have been raped or murdered, to kill more people, even though he's already killing people.
But it felt like a thing a novie needed, because that's what movie's have.
Yeah.
So they did it.
"I've got to walk away from the car for a moment so you can get shot, raped, and then, and then shot again, and also raped some more.
"But not really in that order."
"That's what I get for learning to love somebody again."
Oh...
Oh, my god.
Oh.
Oh, that's different.
This may not be fatal, depending on--
Oh, Jesus.
That's not great.
Oh, my god.
Why did that happen?
That's what happens when cars hit each other.
That car cut the other car in half.
That, wh-, d-...
Oh, god.
He has no emotion on his face.
It's like a step-up.
Mm.
It's a step-up from mildly concerned to moderately concerned.
Is that Ernest Borgnine?
No, it’s Martin Balsam/
Oh, gosh.
Yeah.
It’s a low-rent Ernest Borgnine.
Ernest Borg-not.
Oh.
Or in German, Ernest Borg-nein.
Are we talking about Marina Sirtis and how she violently gets raped in this movie?
Yes.
Well, they rip her shirt off, and it’s horrible.
Well, I will say this movie i, is, uh, much lower...uh, than the first two when it comes to the violent rape. This one’s just a little rapey, which I’ll take.
We saw--
I’ll take that over, over very rapey.
We saw the Cannon Films documentary and Marina Sirtis is briefly interviewed in that.
Yes
And, and can you describe...what she said in that?
Oh, well she basically said that Michael Winner’s like a creepy sex pervert and how she, uh, while they were setting up lights and stuff, she wanted, cuz she’s laying there on, like, this dirty, filthy mattress and she’s topless or whatever, and, and she wanted, like, a blanket cuz it was cold.
She was freezing--
She was freezing, and Michael Winner’s like, "No, we can’t light it properly unless I see your tits."
And that’s the director of the Death Wish films.
Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.
Would you say that, that, uh, knowing that story has now tarnished your enjoyment of Death Wish 3?
A little bit, yeah. I mean, uh, if that director is a legit, like, creeper and, and treated his actors like dirt and like, yeah, that’s awful.
That’s awful.
But the movie’s fucking awesome cuz he has a bazooka.
The movie is awesome.
So it’s all worth it.
She’s a Greek actress that’s playing a, a, a Latina woman.
Which...is very odd, we were all initially confused by is like "the, the actor looks like maybe he’s a black guy and Marina Sirtis is Greek and they’re both supposed to be Latino..
Are you, are you, are you adoption-shaming?
She could’ve been adopted by a Hispanic family.
Josh is very against blended families.
Very?
Oh, my god.
Especially light-skinned African American men with Latino accents marrying Greek Latina women.
Well, I--
It’s a very, very, very specific demographic.
Well, I would say if we learned anything between these two movies tonight, it’s that Cannon films, doesn’t matter your ethnicity, as long as you get mowed down by old white dudes.
That’s true.
That’s true.
"I’ve got a plan to save the neighborhood."
"I mail-ordered a gun."
I love that scene though, then he gathers all of his other friends from the building to "come look at this gun that I mail ordered, look at it’s--"
"This doesn’t help you in any way, but I have a gun."
Yes, it’s--
"I am physically aroused."
"When I make my own bullets," and, like, it’s very, he’s, he’s really catching the wave of New York City making some artisanal bullets .
Yeah.
"This gun’ll make them more dead."
Like, there’s a lot of good things in the action scenes in this movie, but every action scene with Charles Bronson is just--
I’m fine with it!
Rich, you’re--
I’m fine with it!
He moved any faster his toupee would fly off.
I mean it’s probably the best film I’ve ever seen in my whole life .
The person that made this, their name is Flamerion Ferreria, the weirdest name ever. Probably a foreigner, as we discussed.
Chuck Norris needs to come after him.
I think they used the audio from, like, the Jim Jones cult.
This story could not handle more than one bad guy.
This story can’t handle a story.
"Judy’s gonna come over and pick a package up from you. And--"
He wants, he wants, she wants him to put his "package in her purse."
His fri-, frisky fingers.
He wants, he uses his "frisky fringers to put his package in her purse."
No, well, yeah, he was gonna hide a valuable object in his house--
A valuable object.
Wait half an hour, and then call the police.
Yes.
So that it seemed like, like Judy stole a valuable object from his house.
With, with frisky fingers.
You know what would’ve been funny is if that little girl overhears the co--, phone conversation between Mulva and the guy and it all sounds like innuendo and the little girl interpreted it as that.
Not, "He’s gonna rape you!"
He was meaning literally.
Gonna put something in her purse.
"For something in her purse"
"Oh, that’s still bad."
"Oh, I thought you were talking about fucking her to death."
Cuz these orphans have lived a hard life.
They have.
They expect the worst.
Yeah, they, they’re not.
They make friends with trees.
Is this The Lord of the Rings?
Jesus Christ.
"And I’m out of food so I’m going to have to eat you."
The scene where he has to pick up the rock.
Yeah, I have no idea, like, if this aired...somewhere, or if it just came into being.
Well, it’s a Collectible Classic.
Someone discovered it in a castle.
I have no idea how this film came to exist.
Whenever I see something like this, I always, I always imagine, like, cuz the characters, they look Disney-ish.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
They look 90's Disney-ish.
And I always picture someone, some sucker buying it, putting it on for their kids.
"Mommy, this is shitty!"
"Oh yeah, it is."
"We got it at the dollar store."
He doesn’t look anything like David Bowie.
Chuck Norris, he’s a former guy...
He’s still a guy.
I think I can fix this."
We’ve wrapped it up.
That was Christmas.
Oh, I guess we’re just done.
Goodbye.
Done.
He’s pulling a Charles Bronson.
He’s not caring.
If it’s not too late to ask Santa for something, ask him for a copy of Death Wish 3.
