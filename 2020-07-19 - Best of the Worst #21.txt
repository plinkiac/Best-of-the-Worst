welcome back everybody we did it we did
it
we are here there are four of us here we
are not social distancing
no I'm way too close
I'm sorry I'm sorry none of us are
wearing masks
we are less than six feet apart and we
all got together and watched
random videos that we selected on a
wooden wheel
we're all gonna die and we are all
white
uh the first video oh I should be the
one to talk about this yeah you should
selected on the wheel of the worst
fascinating little video called turtle
dreams
Turtle Dreams producer susan dowling
length 2753 september 2nd 1983 wgbh tv
boston
rich this was your favorite video right
yes you're a big fan of
uh avant-garde's experimental art
look look everything else sucks this is
amazing
this is at least entertaining even
though this is everything I hate
everything I despise is contained within
this that's very interesting
if I owned like a bar and it was like
closing time
i I'd put this on it's like turn the
volume up
it's like she's she's got a bad case of
the hiccups but she's also having an
orgasm oh there it is she hit it
i hate these people so much it's that
that pretentious
art school thing where they they think
they're so important
and serious and they're not saying
anything no or are they
see that normally on an on an average
episode of best of the worst
we'll take a movie off the shelf and we
have the luxury of reading the back of
the box
the wheel we don't this whole video
we're confounded
by what the hell was going on josh well
you wait wait you have the opportunity
there is text
yes there is that was just uncovered
that's just on the back that's not going
to you just just take the sticks
out yeah read that text maybe it will
shine a light
on this turtle shell let's let's get
information about these Turtle Dreams by
meredith monk all right very curious
Turtle Dreams 1983 was created by the
dance theater artist and composer
meredith monk
the video is a collage style work that
juxtaposes minimalist movement phrasing
and vocal work
with images of a life turtle traversing
various terrains
so they're just saying literally what we
watched oh that didn't help at all
that just tells us what we know we saw
we're not done
okay there's more
the turtle is pictured both in an
outdoor natural habitat and roaming
through constructed sets
the moon's surface a city block which
play with scale to make the turtle seem
gigantic it's literal
the performers execute shifting
movements and sing repetitive sounds
against a spare backdrop
close-ups of their features and hands
appear oh my god
the end that that is the literal
interpretation of someone who
was was outside of the production yeah
yeah that was just something that worked
at pbs
it's like what do I write not even that
there's no
clue in that description as to what is
meant by this people oh my god the
librarian
the back would say something about like
what this is meant to be
how what you're meant to interpret and
the thing is we need to talk about this
because what this is
is an avant-garde musical piece with
specific
choreography given to it and performed
by meredith monk and three others
it looks like he's trying not to laugh
there has to be context there must be
context
it's not it's not
it's not just you know a sweet generally
like you see it and
it doesn't mean anything more than that
it has to mean something more than that
it means something to meredith monk
it must does it yes I have a feeling
that these avant-garde art assholes
they have no idea what they're doing but
they they know what their peers are
doing
and they're just trying to top their
pages this is you being dismissive of
art rich
yeah rich is dismissive of art yeah
particularly of on guard arts yes
and I understand the the the desire to
just write it off
because when we started watching this it
felt like a parody of avant-garde it's
funny it does it was it was
a very it was a very tampon in a teacup
well what do we have here margaret
it's a tampon in a teacup yes kind of
situation yes
the ghost world father mirror right yeah
yeah
yes and it's it's it's more than that
but I don't know how much more
i had a working theory when I was
watching it and and i
i pulled it was like oh my god grasping
at straws
but I pulled something yeah out of it it
was
uh okay the chanting sound sounds kind
of
native american kind of tribal right
they kept cutting randomly they kept
cutting to
the very extreme oh my god
maybe five or six times throughout the
whole film randomly they would cut to
the
extreme close-up of someone who looked
like either native american
or spanish yeah it was just eyes and it
was like yeah it was like moderately
cinematic looking as far as the lighting
goes
different and compared to everything
else so you had the the kind of the
tribalish
chanting um you have four four whites
uh black and white white background you
know black clothing
and then you have the image of the
turtle maybe kind of some kind of
folklorish
native american naturally initially seen
in a very traditional
yes you know habitat river river water
and then that sort of
starts globetrotting like indiana jones
there's yes then it cuts to him
in a decimated like western city
yeah downtown like there's there's dust
everywhere and there's abandoned cars
yeah the turtles crossing it seems to
imply like a nuclear
just describing this is like the back of
the box all over again you're just
describing the images
you're bringing in a native american
aspect I'm pulling out some kind of
cultural like like almost uh sympathy or
um oh my god some kind of like
like um we feel bad for what we have
done to the native americans
that's that's the only thing that's what
mike and I'm talking on a one percent
kind of level
because the rest of the video is as
people awkwardly
wailing and and walking back and forth
the recording of the music I found very
interesting because
it's like new age barbershop quartet
that's a great title new age barbershop
quartet
oh good night we're done
and that seemed to juxtapose like why
why
why necessarily does this have to be so
direct
where what you're seeing on the video is
such a
large space it feels like it should be
um just a little more spacial a little
more like like in the environment
the real problem is with this piece like
we don't have any background as to we
didn't have any prep as to what it was
so we just have to take it as what it is
and we it's it's
it's bad
when we're just looking at it on a
surface level
and we don't have any information as to
what it's supposed to be meaning what
it's supposed to be pointing at
it's just a bunch of people moving
around semi
randomly and wailing cutting to
some you know cloaked figures lying on
the ground
and then there are turtles but it
doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it should
add up to something no it doesn't
i hold it in utter contempt I understand
that and yet it is the thing you love
the most tonight
and that's fascinating
that that is that is very intriguing i
laughed at it sure yeah
it feels like uh like you mentioned
ghostworld the the tampon and teacup
it feels like if you're watching a movie
that is has a segment of the film that
is making fun of
performance art like this is what you do
like uh was it the big lebowski the his
landlord
he's doing his dancing around in his
little costume not dissimilar it's yeah
it feels like that it feels like a
parody
yeah but josh you mentioned the the
audio quality and
and yes you're right it it was
pre-recorded
and and so that that that adds a whole
other layer to it because
say they had like shotgun mics on the
set right and they're just like going
but remember there was that one moment
where I was like I was like oh my god
you know
this person and this person are doing
this thing yeah which means
this is premeditated it was premeditated
very much
oh don't forget this let's need to do
some of that you're a cat playing with a
string
you're the ninjas are attacking
this the strange thing is is there's
very specific
movements oh yeah and like somebody
thought of that and said you have to do
this at this time and
that's what I'm saying it means
something to someone yeah I i
i don't get like dance performance art i
just don't understand
it's garbage it was planned out the move
the body movements were planned out they
seemed to be very
very audio the yelling the chanting the
yoko ono s
uh garbling
whatever you want to call it
alternate between phrases I'm I went to
the store I  I went to the store I went to
the store
i went to the start
what is she saying I think she went to
the store which maybe is meant to kind
of like
put you in like maybe ground you a
little bit and be like everybody goes to
the store
but then from there it kind of devolves
into
phonemes and just you know noises
yeah yeah and it's hard to get something
out of that
is this where the turtle comes from
yes oh my god there's an actual turtle
i honestly wasn't expecting that I do
want to say that turtle was on the
goddamn moon
but the problem the problem is that it
was looking at the moon while it was on
the moon so
the moon has its own satellite which
looks
just like the moon sure
it's a government conspiracy they're
hiding the truth
it's in the dark side it's called the
double moon theory
moon and a little moon
is that song by the band called the
turtles yeah it is
there we go josh where were you
i think he was just uh transfixed by
your vocals I was mildly confused and
frankly that's
my review of Turtle Dreams by meredith
monk I was mildly confused
i think I think we've talked enough
about Turtle Dreams I understand turtle
dreams I don't like it but I understand
it
i don't understand it and I don't like
it no fair enough I don't understand it
and I both
don't like it and like it it's not even
it's not evoking anything
that's yeah exactly
like even just the fact that it's turtle
dreams and there are turtles doesn't no
no don't say that it's invoking a lot of
confusion
any art can do that right
yeah that's art and then I would move on
to the next exhibit
but at least you can recognize it as art
and learn anything
interesting well that's true seafood
attitude is art
um
and the juice is clear
our next movie was safe food attitude
with with featuring the the kick and rap
group
to be moms oh shit uh
of rich would you like to talk about the
same food attitude
yes I would thank you
anyway so how about tell me about food
safety rich
in in with the rapping style this is
very
it's very 90s there's one very 90s rap
what are they rapping about the first
one germs the whole thing is about germs
and like raw chicken
that's the whole fucking video the first
one is how you need to keep your meat
between zero and 40 degrees
is that what it was yeah okay I remember
the grocery store
yeah yeah and you have to look at that's
when we got nostalgic for going to the
grocery store under normal circumstances
first things first disinfect your
shopping cart
says stay away from people and it's just
full of people
that's just everybody's in the grocery
store just hanging around each other
real close
oh you guys remember shopping
it was weird
well shopping's still a thing it's just
horrific yeah
it is yeah they need to do a follow-up
video to this same wrap-in but they're
all wearing masks and
two of them are just at home on their on
their laptops ordering
just for delivery yeah and it wasn't
like an apocalypse movie
where you had to avoid other people she
didn't know if they were gonna like
murder you
they're they're taking they're taking
their sweet time reading the nutritional
charts on all the cereals they're just
picking up items and putting them back
on the shelf you can't do that
and just licking everything yeah just
licking it so on the fresh prince set
there was a there was a video yeah i
thought that was gonna be the whole
video it was like
rap song after rap song about various
things
I'm gonna tell you I was excited that
would have been fun that was segment one
yes segment like two through like
six are just very lame I can't even call
them
skits the julia child song
yeah that wasn't that was barely I mean
they were all variations on the same
topic which is
wash your hands which is very relevant
now um
don't don't like fuck around with raw
chicken and don't get germs on things
and that was it oh oh oh and don't eat
dirty cat litter
oh yeah we had to wait we had to wait
all the way to the other rap for that
one
they were they were very specific about
cat litter yeah it was weird now I know
your kitty is looking real
jump from a pretty kitty little which
smells a little bitter can make you feel
very low
so don't eat cat litter dude
just don't mess with that in other words
from john's
shit she's saying don't pick up your cat
litter and put it in your mouth
almost all those young mothers just want
to put
cat litter in their mouth we need to get
the word out food preparation food
preparation be safe
with your food put your food in the
fridge uh don't do this with your food
cook your food this much
make sure you wash your hands and you
wash your dishes washers they're gonna
be close to the salad when you have the
chicken
oh and don't eat dirty cat litter
well the the confusing thing was who is
this aimed at
because it's all common sense stuff that
any adult would know and you kind of
came up with the idea that this was a
video aimed at like
14 year olds that get pregnant I really
strongly agree with that
mike like had a very strong idea that
this is for
children that are pregnant well you're
looking at the night babies
the hip hop like it's trying to be a hip
video yeah
so it's like where do you market to
pregnant 14 year olds
high schoolers this goes in the high
school like detention
uh area oh the guidance counselor has a
guidance counselor has a copy of this oh
yeah
she goes the hip guidance counselor like
the cool one
the girl tells you I'm pregnant and I'm
keeping it you know oh you're only a
freshman
oh well here's a video about how you
shouldn't eat cat shit
this birthing stuff is hard this is just
the practice part
yeah you think this is hard work wait
till the real thing you're gonna shit
yourself
so three rules you need to follow the
litter box is not for you
cause it's like it's like okay well they
they explain like okay I got raw
raw chicken I gotta put in the fridge
for because I'm going to cook it later
at the
cookout but I have this plate of
vegetables so it's like
well don't put the raw chicken you know
just on a
piece of saran wrap above the the raw
vegetable now put it on a paper plate
because that's definitely
put it on something where it's not going
to drip onto the raw vegetables like a
14 year old
might not know that and they might not
know that it's super fucking dangerous
to undercook
poultry yes because you can get food
poisoning yeah get back in the oven
and don't come back to your juices run
clear but what if you're not a pregnant
14 year old is it not important at all
then then you can just eat all the raw
chicken and cat shit you want
fucking you should have seen me at 14
pal
just just just like handfuls of kitty
litter just shift them down your mouth
and look at me today I think the logic
is if you're
if you're 14 15 and you're pregnant then
you you have to kind of fast forward
into adulthood
you've got to you've got to think about
a baby you've got to start cooking for
yourself
maybe you're not living at home anymore
we all know the grandparents are going
to end up raising the kids
probably but but the the the
the earnestness is there the the the
purpose is there
you know a normal 14 year old kid isn't
isn't going to check the temperature on
the chicken breast
when before they eat it right their
mom's going to do that but if you're
with you yeah you find yourself in a
situation where you're pregnant
you're raising your own kid you might
have to start cooking for yourself
and what yeah what I will say to like
agree with this is that
a lot of these things could feel like a
cash grab this doesn't feel like a cash
grab at any point
it just feels like it's got one point
that it needs to get across and it's
doing it repeatedly yeah yeah but it
doesn't feel like they're trying to make
money off of it
now we're not looking for trouble today
we're just looking for meats that taste
delicious
it feels like they're also trying trying
to lure in the horror crowd because they
cast felicia rose from sleep away camp
as one of the 2b moms
what the fuck that was the most random
thing ever that doesn't mean anything to
you guys I know but felicia rose is in
this video
pregnant rapper mom some weirdo
collector people are gonna need to have
this video now
you're welcome yeah sometimes the things
that you love to touch
can carry nasty things like them germs
and such when that unborn baby inside of
you
special indication to stay away from
germs all I know is if I didn't mention
that felicia rose was in this every
comment under the video I can't believe
you guys didn't know this I can't
believe you guys didn't make sure
yeah so I mentioned it it's out of the
way we can fucking move on with our
lives
i don't know why none of that was
english to me
doesn't have to be we're not concerned
we have things you can talk about later
i have not been to this sleep away camp
i didn't do much camping as a young man
I've never been camping
yeah we are animals we just happen to
think a little more clearly than the
dolphins
we're special we're special we got
thumbs and shit
yeah we got opposable thumbs and
we we use twitter that's the only
difference
and that makes us more intelligent I'm
saying I'm using my opposable thumb like
that for
business I'm betting the evolution on on
dolphins yeah you think you're going to
overtake us yeah I think so yeah they're
smart
they are I wish they just weren't so
rapey are dolphins rabies
dolphins are famously rapey
the dolphin slams billy against the
concrete wall
something has provoked these dolphins
into a frenzy
and caused one of them to attack
yeah it's it's fucking weird is it rape
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well they'll
rape like humans
oh oh but it's it's sharks that date
rape though
sharks sharks like um knock the female
out
and they impregnate them while they're
unconscious certain breeds of sharks
man that sounds like a culture
difference I'm not so sure you know
they did an experiment where they had a
woman live with a dolphin
and they didn't tell the woman but i
think the secret she said it was the
best year of her life they were going to
see if she would fall in love with the
dolphin and vice versa
oh and I think she ended up giving the
dolphin a handy because the
dolphin became quite enamored of her
yeah
i don't want to hear about this anymore
I've uh I i I am
unfortunately aware of um at least one
book where
someone says don't tell stories about
your mom
yeah I i it's good you didn't
you don't have to wash them so often and
with plenty of extras around if you're
in a hurry you won't take such a chance
on using one that hasn't been cleaned
girl look at this creep back here
fucking john favreau
does she know him I don't know it's just
some guy are they siamese twins
well did we talk all about the vignettes
and
say food attitude oh we didn't mention
that this is this has a segment of this
is the first found footage film
I'm trying to think of what else top
what other topics they could cover don't
drink booze while you're pregnant
wash your vegetables cook the meat
properly
what the oh my god whoa oh
we get we got that camcorder pov footage
yeah there's that small child but
annoying her mom
that is a is she learning disabilities
say am I on candid camera
no silly if it was a candy camera it'd
be all gone by now
I'd look it up oh no dear you're very
dumb
why would you say that because she's
really scared oh that's right she keeps
mispronouncing words yeah well the meat
is perishable honey
and the cooler helps keep it safe
perish a bubble mom is it gonna pop like
a balloon
there's nothing wrong with
mispronouncing words
the mom said something and she's like oh
she's like pasta bubble bubble
yeah yeah she keeps mishearing it and
then she goes over to grandpa who's in
the witness protection
cooper so he's like no picture he's like
stop stop it stop filming me
what was that what was that video oh my
gosh
oh my gosh captain marvel
am I saying that I hate white dudes no
I'm not
what um oh god remember the guy with the
with the guitar
oh uh billy b billy b that's what i
thought this was going to be
song after song that's that's exactly
what I was getting to is that you think
like you're going to have like a like a
bad hip-hop song
and then the the the girls get together
and go help
another song is exactly the same but
they cut from this and then they cut to
the scenario with
with her and her husband and he's
cooking the food super germaphobes and
yeah they're big
she's like wash wash out the germs germs
you know cleaning your hands around food
just like washing kitchen sponges and
dish towels
is just another way that your actions
speak louder than words
clean clean clean I'm just trying to
cook there
I'm just trying to keep you and the baby
safe dear
we've got the chefs to light stir fry
tonight okay they're going to kill each
other at the end of this right
this is real tense and then there's the
orgy
then there's the orgy scene where all
the adults get together they're gonna
like I don't know they just had dinner
they're gonna play some games they have
appetizers they're like you gotta lead
up to the orgy you can't just go right
into it
well now that the food is safely put
away why don't we go sit down sure
why don't we
they have to they have to put away the
snacks and appetizers before the orgy
and then so they have to get them back
out and warm them up again
they're like why are you wasting your
time putting all those snacks into
plastic containers we're just going to
cover them on our genitals in a bit
anyway
you're just going to beat the food out
you're going to be licking the onion dip
off my
tape and about about 15 why put it in
the plastic bowl
it's just unsafe mike you gotta you
gotta be safe she's like we gotta put it
in a plastic bowl
if it's out for more than 30 minutes it
gets joined
and so it ends up in the fridge there's
already germs in my teeth
i haven't showered in six weeks
should we try and clean up a little um
no that was part of your kick
the whole plan heat your leftovers until
they're hot and steamy
last week I made you eat kitty litter
dig around in the kitty litter till you
find the lump
give me the nuggets the chicken nuggets
and the kitty litter
it's got like a hole in the bottom of
the kitty litter bin
good idea then we can just pick out the
whenever we want some
are you guys crazy what do you want to
do make everyone sick
oh god
kitty laid a big one
just move move on do they still do lamas
or was that just like an 80s they're
gonna say
they still have orgies yeah no are orgy
still a thing
not right now right now
they've been they've been canceled due
to corona
orgy cancelled they have skype orgies
I'm sure
right now oh probably oh sure yeah zoom
they have zoom orgies
zoom g's oh god yeah can you imagine
that oh that's a real thing
I'm sure it is yeah zoom orgy yeah
somebody out there has done it just just
you know you tell people just jacking
and gelling it all across the world
it's fine hey you know you can't leave
the house you got to get your rocks off
somehow I'm not judging yeah but it's on
some kind of server somewhere
oh it's saved oh you better believe it
so just remember that
now we can have leftovers that are tasty
and safe to eat
yes miss tv
oh god uh so jay
ow I feel like I need to ask you about
princess parties I don't know why
well um you've hosted many at princeton
i have hosted many princess parties
and uh how to host a Princess Party is
the last ditch effort from an aging
entertainer to finally make some cash
I'm gwendoline the good fairy and this
is my puppy kill me paper
peeper and I love going to prince's
birthday parties
she never should have left cheers
first troop beverly hills and now this
her name is jane and she's from
davenport
she used to work in hollywood she ran
out of money she had to go back home to
davenport iowa
and now she uh is princess gwendolyn for
little children's birthday parties and
this is her video about how to host your
own Princess Party
really I think she was a bored housewife
who just found a neat niche
that could be it too yeah there's
there's many possibilities we can write
all sorts of fanfiction
our theory initially was that she had
that wedding dress that she never used
yeah so she went ahead and found a use
for it with
with her her little dog peeper now
let's explore the inside of the house
with gwendolyn oh god oh god gwendolyn
showed up
she wasn't even invited I heard there
was a party
it's my house now
I'm commandeering this party who are you
are you sticking our silverware under
your dress
princess gwendolyn has a dog named
peeper who would rather be anywhere else
what colors do I really really like
fuck out of here is she a princess or a
fairy girl
she's a princess she's a princess she's
modeled after the fairy godmother she's
a fairy princess
oh god the mixing she's very much like
um
she's like a good witch
just enough to avoid copyright rules
just enough she doesn't have the same
she even has the same scepter yeah and
she has this weird cooing thing that she
does when magic happens
yeah her voice is a little annoying and
a little phony just a little
hello princess and hello dear friends
welcome to my castle oh it's definitely
phony because
she she breaks into her real self in the
outtakes oh I see I missed the outfit oh
no that's not her real voice
i think we all know that
okay hold the magic wand and twirl
around
place it on the ferry oh bitch you
missed oh you're stuck
you're stupid
you're very bad at this and you'll never
amount to anything
hear you ugly girl just starts insulting
everybody
but she says it pleasantly yeah you're
what they call
homely
you might marry but probably not
your real voice is okay I've come here
to entertain your children
i love cool I need cash up front
they have isn't that a segment of the
video towards the end where they say
like
the payment to your entertainers for
your party well
this was a really interesting thing that
we were trying to figure out through the
whole video actually
yeah it was just that we were like oh is
this a pitch for her
yeah it feels like the whole video is
just oh princess gwendolyn hire her for
your parties
but there's not a big no endorsement at
the end just like you would expect
it really is her intentions may be
sincere of just like hey your kid might
want to have a fun
princess birthday party yeah so spend
three weeks cutting out stars and
putting them on the wall
yeah throw tinsel all around the floor
get your alcoholic husband to help out
just three weeks if you know if you
don't have anything else to do
maybe she was maybe she started off as
like you know the equivalent of a
fairy Princess Party clown going to kids
parties locally and now
she's trying to expand her business or
she's trying to find a way
that she can stay home but expand the
idea of her business
sure through this to to sell to other
people
to be the fairy godmother that's a good
point this is this is step two
out of a three-step process step one I'm
I'm
I'm for either a former porn actress or
or former failed soap opera actress
but I have gained experience gained
experience I've done some local
parties in the los angeles area
davenport davenport area
as a as a Princess Party clown now
step two create a video and create an
uh a trademarked product a brand
brand thank you that's princess parties
is that the brand yes
and then hire much much
much younger women to show up to kids
birthday parties as
the fairy princess to to host as
under the prince princess gwendolyn
trademark I'm princess gwendolyn it's a
very interesting idea but we're
still missing that from the video don't
forget to decorate the halls
he's faking it you fraud oh no
not on the carpet just dump some shit on
the floor whatever
the fuck's gonna clean this
tinsel on the car up oh what a nightmare
ashley even taped cut out stars to the
walls of the party room
uh ashley did I'm pretty sure dad did
ashley also placed the balloon weights
that mommy and daddy what the fuck is
that
jay would you want to cut out that many
fucking pastel stars
the dad in this video definitely didn't
want to hell no he was downstairs
you know what jesse I think they cut out
so many stars
and they showed that angry dad who was
clearly drunk
that he had his t-shirt tucked into his
shorts
something was wrong with that guy with
the print with the Princess Party
executive package all those stars come
pre-cut
a team of seven or eight people come to
the house and hang them all up and
a team of seven or eight drunk dads come
to your house and do it
yeah they have uniforms important thing
is you are doing it
yeah but it's a bunch of other drunk
middle-aged dudes with their shirts
tucked into their shorts sounds awesome
they show up and they hang those fucking
stars all over your living room
and then they spill that tassel all over
the carpet it's a fucking nightmare
so much glitter she she makes it look so
fucking annoying that you you will pay
to have somebody else do it transfer
transform your house
into a pink and purple nightmare for an
extra eight hundred dollars
we get rid of the glitter after gonna
say you think
she's got a contact with stanley steemer
to come in yeah that would be the better
business is cleaning up all this shit
after the fact
it wasn't princess ashley's birthday
party fun
people and I had a wonderful time
really nice people you did you shit
behind the couch and we didn't tell them
princess gwendolyn she has her own
castle
it's a real castle oh yeah it's got a
it's got another dimension in there
um yeah yeah the door opens
you suppose she drags that with her to
the party she would do I was thinking
about that because it's like that's a
prop
somebody made did they make it just for
this video
i have a third theory oh no she created
this video
as a ruse to make it look like she was
famous
to spread this video around
to get rich parents to pay
her specifically even though it's not
it's not implicitly
implied they'll go who is this wwe
gwendolyn she has her own dvd exactly
you know where I'm going with this yeah
she must be something
well let me contact her privately okay
well the video says that you know you
how do you know
things you should do when contacting an
entertainer I wonder if princess
gwendolyn does entertainment you know
where I'm going she doesn't offer her
services but maybe
since we have so much money darling
we could contact her privately and our
daughter's dreams will come true
when literally the actual princess
gwendolyn from the video
shows up to her Princess Party
for 24 000 and she shows
up it's a miracle darling we're the
richest people in davenport iowa
let's just call princess princess
gwendolyn
printed a hundred princess gwendolyn
priced a thousand of these dvds yeah and
drove from
davenport iowa to the hamptons and left
them in
all the coffee shops and wine bars
and men's bathrooms men's bathrooms and
then drove back to davenport and just
waited for the phone

you fifty thousand quid
to come and dance around for my
daughter's party
and my husband would like to have his
way with you
after the party that's where she really
makes her money yeah
that's called the cleanup so then she
pulls up on the rusty pickup truck with
like
the plywood castle jammed in the back
that castle in the backyard
now when I do my business with the
mister of the house bubba

carried off in the storm
star's blown out all over the place no
trail of stars
pastel stuff stopped by the sheets i
want a burger
it's like simon says okay but you have
to do whatever it is that I ask you to
do
if I don't say the good fairy sis then
don't do it okay
she makes twenty thousand twenty to
thirty thousand for the children's party
for the children's prayer
and an extra five for the happy ending
you know the the mystery of the house
you mean the happy ending like when she
leaves the party and all the children
are excited because they had such a
magical birthday party oh
yeah that's that's what that's what you
mean that's how it's reported on the tax
returns
but the daughter gets a Princess Party
as does the dad
he gets his own Princess Party is that
his fetish
yeah it's a very specific clientele wow
you know what
listen I don't I respect her completely
you when you find that niche and you go
for it it's a specific niche
it's like a double niche and and and
she knows exactly where it's at and you
know she's hosted
thousands of princess parties
be sure to ask the entertainer first can
you tell me about your experiences as an
entertainer
all right uh well we normally when we do
the wheel
we do three videos yeah but we do
whatever reason
we did three videos but then we have a
fourth well we didn't we didn't think
there'd be much to talk about with
safe food attitude yeah we got more out
of this with the discussion
than we did with Turtle Dreams oddly
enough but we we thought we'd need
more more more discussing more more you
know who's we
yeah don't say we
they're gonna they're gonna move down to
the groin
the inner thigh do you want to take this
video home
i was not in favor of this for the
get-go basically mike all right
and I largely I i don't even think
that's true he just wanted to watch
the elderly massage video so much he
wanted to make
us watch the elderly massage videos
that's what it is so we watched
Massaging the Elderly
when sometimes
the hair is not shampooed as often you
may
accumulate a dandruff and if this
is not come off then
it may even get a little scabby I was
really hoping
to get Massaging the Elderly why because
it's called Massaging the Elderly yes
there's a picture of a butterfly
and it says geriatric massage techniques
with dietrich von meisler
hi I'm dietrich miesler
I'm with daybreak stress and pain
control in guernsey eastern california
and I would like to introduce you to a
tape that is about massaging elderly
former
you don't know that that's our own
fanfiction
cooper's in that video that might as
well be it's possible
we don't know we're just making shit up
he escaped
fled to south america learned the the
techniques of Massaging the Elderly
and then moved to sedona arizona while
he made
vhs tapes instructing others how to
put lotion on the backs of elderly men
and yes
yes it's
throughout the video if you have a
corpse with tiny whities on
this is what to do with it yeah yeah
until today you can practice on grandma
again hear the colon is going down
going down on the side and here we lose
it it
comes through
oh grandpa was gassy quite hard
listen I had I had I i I had a four
count
uh you know concern for this video which
is neck back pussy and crack
i got three of them although we did
leave the room at a certain point and
that's important to point out this could
have happened it could have happened
while we were out of the room the only
one that was left was mike
uh we weren't watching anymore no there
was we all gave up
pizza and I wanted to go have that yeah
butterfly
wings are touching fluttering against
the leg
now my reasoning was to first of all
stimulate
the skin and do very gentle moves that
might
possibly initiate blood flow
i I i peeked in occasionally but can we
can we all agree
that hold on can we all agree that
until today no one has ever thought
about how the elderly might need a
massage
yes yes yes yes because we can also
agree
that none of us wanted to see the
elderly getting massages
we don't want to see the crack we don't
want to see the taint oh we definitely
don't want to see the feet
oh those feet um
but you're talking about a tarantino
antiboner those feet
can I just say something to the three of
you yeah we saw this
those those nasty elderly feet
with with the fungus infected toes
the deformed toes and and I just want to
say
that it's in your memories forever
mike you do realize that someday someday
very soon
karma is gonna hit you like a freight
train
can I also say to you the image
of the elderly crack and the deformed
fungus ridden toes are in your mind
forever
why is it you instantly forget every
other movie you've seen
10 minutes after you've seen it but
every single fucking image of the
elderly massage video is apparently
burned into your brain
can you explain this I just want to know
like why it went between the tidy
whities
and the towel over the tighty whities
sometimes from the same
like scene or perspective it would
change
that towel would disappear listen he had
to hold down his boner
at one point yeah he had to have his oh
yeah he was touching his dick yeah that
was
that was uncomfortable yeah when there
was a little kind of a little down into
the
the d'angelo area as I like to call it
it's kind of pointing you down in that
area you know we saw the the old
lady who said that that she had trouble
with in her vaginal region and then i
cut right to the old man again and was
like okay come on
hallucinating things I i think this is
mike yeah this is what he wished was in
the video
we had we had we had we had uh the
german fellow
telling you how to push the the the poop
around and yeah that was the most
uncomfortable
and not press on the bladder don't press
on the bladder the bladder is right here
up here on this side is the colon get
the poop out but not the point you can
you can move the pooper that was the
belly that was the belly
yeah he was showing you the direction to
to massage the belly
to get cold it feels like it feels like
a lump of coal
and you can push it through this elderly
man but don't go near his bladder
you don't want him to piss you just want
him to shit himself yeah but I don't
know
that was true that's his last poop why
are we talking about this
but I don't remember anybody any woman
having a problem with her vagina like i
don't
he doesn't give up that's the main thing
I've found with him it seems like
he really cares about it was beatrice
that was chapter six uh uh the the
abdomen maybe this is after we left the
room oh my god
massaging the alzheimer's patient did we
miss that part
no this is other videos fine massaging
the alzheimer's patient
rub them till they can't remember are we
sure this isn't a series of fetish
videos
no I'm not I'm not sure of that at all
massaging the penis
the pain is now concentrated this just
makes me sad
where are you going richard I don't know
jay don't let him leave
close the door jay don't let him leave
run rich run
yeah and then and then you made us watch
that and then you made us watch this
so many men were done after princess
gwendolyn
but that's but you were done after
beside the elders
yeah you you weren't done you had a ways
to go I'll
open the magic door of wishes and dreams
don't forget the lady who
just got out of prison work release who
couldn't get the job
at the grocery store who had to take the
job massaging elderly is she the one
that's hanging out with the serial
killer guy
yes and then the serial killer guy the
guy with the mustache who's
who's covering his erection with his
hands who's there
for god knows what and he's there to
learn how to massage the elderly
those are also interesting characters
other than
heinrich von the former
jesus who escaped south america under
the guise of being
an elderly masseuse to escape
war crimes aren't are you getting what i
got out of this video is this going to
affect your monetization
i don't know what the rules are on
youtube anymore the robot the
youtube robot hears more than twice
it starts to affect her or they see
footage of an elderly person being
rubbed
we're done for our entire channel is
going to be nuked from existence
i think it might just confuse the
algorithm enough
to cause it to not know what to do we're
going to cause a short circuit and the
whole system
will collapse all because I'm back on
board I'm back on board
we're gonna bring the whole system down
baby scanning for content scanning for
cut
what the fuck
we're gonna we're gonna get a flag for
improper cooking of raw chicken
no improper
food food preparation
jay okay you watch this video sort of
and and now you find yourself in a
situation where you have a bottle of
lotion
a pair of tiny whities and an elderly
man
and you're told to massage him what do
you do
i call you and I say no come on over
you're the expert you're clearly into
this I'm leaving
rich entirely yeah rinse is gone god
it's not even shark exercise
you know what because he doesn't want me
to ask him
he knows he's next
what if they say my inner groin
is really hurting me you know I'm not a
doctor and that's something you're going
to need to take care of yourself
well you're a massage therapist I'm not
well you're practicing to become one
no I'm not the man wants you mike's
writing
fan fiction about josh right the man
wants you
to make sure his grundle is not sore
I'm not paid well enough for that okay
pain that you can see is considered a
varicose vein
actually only any any vein that is
collapsed so that it is raised and that
it collects blood
as I pointed out on the booklet there is
a great variation
among old people of the same so jay
what's your choice for best of the worst
uh oh it's Turtle Dreams
that was the most entertaining all right
mike
what's your twister festival um
i think it's how to host a princess
party
you have to pick this because the only
reason we watched it is because of you
no I watched it out of curiosity wrong
yeah
we started out of curiosity but you made
us continue
to watch it
I was hoping it would get more awkward and inappropriate.
All I wanted was that old man in his underwear to flip over and kind of, like, spread his legs apart and start massaging his taint.
And I was really hoping for that.
And it didn't happen.
It was just boring.
So Princess Party is yours?
My vote is Princess Party.
You see, Massaging the Elderly already served its purpose of making us miserable.
Yeah.
And after that, Mike was done with it.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Rich Evans, what is your choice for Best of the Worst tonight?
Shockingly, I'm going with Turtle Dreams.
I'm not shocked with that at all.
Being some of the most jaw-dropping cringe embarrassment I've ever seen.
The fact that somebody out there can take this and themselves seriously is amazing to me.
Josh, what's your Best of the Worst?
I gotta admit it, uh, initially it was gonna be Turtle Dreams, but, uh, once we came up with the back story, I'm with the Princess Party.
Oh, my god.
Damn.
Yes!
Yes!
There's really it's just there's so many levels there that we could dig into.
Like, Turtle Dreams, as much as, actually, I pretty much admired it before its existence.
Not that it's good.
It's bad.
But it's very surface.
It's just, it is what it is.
Um, can we do something to Massaging the Elderly?
Yes, let's fucking destroy it.
No!
What?
Oh.
What the fuck?
Am I supposed to do this, too?
How long does this go on for?
Okay, what the fuck is this?
Oh, my god.
The light fell over, and it's smoking.
