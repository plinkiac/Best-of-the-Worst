Jack: Oh no. Guys, we forgot Jay in the studio. And now he’s withered away to a skeleton. A tiny, tiny man skeleton. He’s had no food or water. And he’s dead [Jay walks in, music stops playing] Oh! Oh, hi, hi Jay
Jay: What’s goin’ on?
JK: [Makes shrugging gesture] No--there’s, you know….
J: Did you think that comically small skeleton was me?
JK…....Yes?
J: Happy Halloween, Jack!
JK: A spooky Halloween to you too, Jay
J: Are you ready to be spooked out? On this Halloween Spooktacular
JK: Very much so
J: We have three very scary films. The first of which is Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park
JK: “Featuring Rock & Roll All Night, Shout It Out Loud, and Beth”
J: Ok, so their songs are actually in it
JK: Well, two songs--and actual Beth. Like the--she’s an actress
J: Oh, Beth! I remember her from…
JK: You know her [Silence] “This dynamic rock group makes their film debut in a spine-tingling mystery that matches Kiss’s extraordinary powers against a demented genius inventor. Peter Cris--”
J: What are their extraordinary powers? [Jack begins to answer] Marketing every possible thing imaginable? [Shows a slideshow of Kiss merchandise. The last one is a coffin]
JK: I think that’s part of Kiss’s shtick though, is like they--they have like...demonic powers...
J: Oh ok
JK: Like the star….
J: I don’t know much about Kiss, I just know Gene Simmons has a really long tongue
JK: That’s true. Uhhh…”Peter Criss (Catman), Ace Frehley (Space Ace), Gene Simmons (The Demon), and Paul Stambl--Stanley”
J: Paul Stammerly?
Mike: [In the background] Oh snap! [Jay and Jack chuckle]
JK: “And Paul Stanley (Starchild), collectively known as Kiss are scheduled for a sell-out concert at California’s Magic Mountain Amusement Park. When park-goers begin to vanish without a trace….”
J: Is this gonna be just a giant ad for this amusement park? Is it gonna be like that Lost in...in Dinosaur World movie we watched?
JK: [Chuckles] It could be that, I’m more guessing this is a “shoot the rodeo” type situation, where they’re randomly going to cut to concert footage...
J: Ok
JK:...that they had. But it’s gonna be in (?)
J: It can’t be that bad, Kiss is alright
JK: Kiss is alright. Uh, let’s see here, “behind it all is Abner Devereaux (Anthony Zebre), the eccentric creator of the park’s lifelike cybernetic creatures….”
J: So we got robots?...Kiss versus robots?
JK: Kiss versus robots
J: In an amusement park, ok
JK: They look like, uh, it looks more like the Putties from the Power Rangers [Indicates the picture of Gene Simmons kicking a bad guy on the back] If you remember those...
J: It does, it looks exactly like those
JK: So I think they’re going to be fighting the Putties [Jay huffs out air] Uhh, “when Melissa (Deborah Ryan) turns to Kiss to help her find her missing boyfriend, Devereaux feels threatened and creates cybernetic Kiss lookalikes!”
J: Oh my god! So it’s like, uhh, Kiss versus robot Kiss, it’s like Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey
JK: Yes
J: [Laughs] Evil robot Kisses
JK: It’s Kiss versus Mecha Kiss
J: [Nods] Hmm
JK: That sounds like an awesome band name, Mecha Kiss
J: Yeah….I know there is, uhh, Mini Kiss? Mini Kiss, where it’s all little people
JK: Adorable?.....Or horrifying [#mini-kiss-shaming appears on screen] Uh, let’s see here, “threatens, uh, creates cybernetic Kiss lookalikes. Featured is some of Kiss’s best music performed with stunning visual effects”
J: I’m sure
[Plays clip]
Rich: [From off screen] Is it gonna end in a band battle to see whose music is more mechanical and lifeless? [Jay laughs]
JK: I’m really excited about this
J: This sounds great. This sounds--
JK: Great
J: --like a lot of fun. Watch us be proven wrong
JK: Right? Time and time again we are
*5 seconds into the film*
R: Oh, I hate it already

[4:35] R: The cameraman’s like a midget. He can’t--he can’t get the hammer--camera quite high enough

[4:54] [One of the members of Kiss floats around in space]
JK: Wha--wha--ho--what’s ha--why--where are they doing this?

[5:25] JK: What are we gonna watch next?
J: Next up...on this spooky Halloween scary spectacular, is Killer Workout. Now this is our second...uh, uh, gym-themed horror film
JK:...Yes
J: We watched Death Spa. We’ll see if this is--is anywhere close to as good as Death Spa
JK: This is our third...if we count...uh, Ninja 3
J: Oh! That’s right! Yeah
JK: The Possession
J: I say we count it, so this is our third...gym horror film
JK: Yes!
J: Which is pretty amazing
JK: Hmm-mm
J: Uh, and it’s directed by the late, great David Prior. Uh, who did Deadly Prey. So, it should be great [Reads the back] “Something very unhealthy is happening at Ronda’s Health Club”
JK: [Barely audible] Nice
J: “Warning: this workout’s a real killer!” Man, they’re just full of ‘em. Full of great lines here. “They came to get their bodies into the best shape of their lives. Too bad they’ll never have the chance to enjoy it”
JK: ‘Cause they’re dead!
J: “In the locker room. In the showers. In the wait room. Even in the parking lot. Someone is turning the most beautiful bodies in town into a grisly, brutal body count. Now nobody’s safe. There’s no place to hide.” Except maybe if you just leave the gym
JK: You should--
J: I would think that would be the best way to, to avoid getting killed, at the gym
JK: So, gratuitous nudity...
J: That’s--yeah, you can see...look at--look at this hot babe [Indicates the woman on the back] 
JK: Boom boom!
J: Hot 80s babe
JK: Uhh, this--this sounds great. I’m pretty adverse to working out in general...and so…you know...
J: This is the movie for you
JK: Yeah--more reasons not to go to the gym
J: Yeah

[7:13] [A woman drops her purse, condoms fall out of it]
JK: Um, excuse me? Visual storytelling? [Jay laughs] 
M: That’s right
JK: You know everything you need to know about her character by her dropping her purse
M: She’s clumsy and she likes to get fucked

[7:31] M: Lots of plot from these scenes
J: Pffftfft
M: Lots of plot
(...)
JK: Really hunch your back, stick out that plot

[7:55] J: Not sure why the….device used for killing is a giant safety pin, but...
JK: Yeah, that’s kind of weird
R: I guess that was a….unsafety pin? [Audience boos]

[8:09] J: Alright, Jack, why don’t you tell us about our third and final film?...Mystics in Bali! [Hands over the tape]
JK: This…[Looks at the tape] looks fascinating [Jay nods] This looks like an arthouse feature, there seems to be a severed head, but not completely severed ‘cause it has all of their internal organs…
J: All--all the insides are on the outside
JK: That’s beautiful. And some sort of Muppet. “A sensation on its initial release in Asia, Mystics in Bali was deemed too bizarre and shocking to be screened in the West. Until now! This is the first time the film has been released in the U.S. and is completely uncut and digitally remastered from the rare original negative.”
J: Isn’t it great that we live in an era of when things like this are being, like, cleaned up and released into the world? They just did an HD restoration of Manos: The Hands of Fate. It’s a great time for--for movies
JK: Ah--how many man hours went into making this beau--look beautiful? That--like...that could've been, you know, they--these people could’ve been picking up garbage on the streets [Jay nods] But they were picking it up in the film…[Jay chuckles, Jack tosses the tape upwards and catches it] Yeah, that’s what I got, um…[Jay laughs] “The film tells the story of a young American woman who goes to Asia in search of the secrets of ancient magic. One night, in the forest, she encounters a female member of the terrifying cult of Leák. She agrees to become the Leák’s disciple...and begins to indulge in many strange and savage rites.” Ooh hoo hoo hoo!
J: This sounds--this sounds great
JK: It sounds like there’s gonna be nudity and magic. I just assume there’s nudity in everything
J: Nudity is magic [Jack raises his eyebrows at the camera, suddenly cuts to him reading the tape]
JK: Uh, let’s see here, “but the Leák witch has secret plans for her young acolyte. Plans that culminate in one of the most bizarre and shocking scenes in all horror cinema!”
J: I’m sure!....That would explain why I’ve never heard of it
JK: Right….This--this sounds great!
J: Oh, is that it?
JK: That’s it
J: Ok [Begins to say something]
JK: That’s what it says, “this sounds great.” 
J: Oh! Ok
JK: And then it says “let’s go watch it.” [Jay chuckles] That’s weird [Walks away] Why would it say that on the DVD?
J: (???) Oh no! The cobwebs [Drops the skeleton] Ahh! Comically wrapped up in the cobwebs again [Tries to untangle from the cobwebs] God damn it!
JK: [Walks back in] Quit playin’ around, Jay! [Picks up the skeleton] Let’s go watch the movie [Leaves]
(???)

[11:35] J: Why is she dressed like Weird Al? [Mike laughs]
R: He’s the Filipino Weird Al [Jay chuckles]
JK: Woah
[Silence]
J: She--
M: She’s--
R: Oh!
J: She’s American
JH: She’s the one that’s--
M: She’s got a weird--
J: Weird Al does not...he’s not known for wearing Notre Dame t-shirts [Zooms in on the guy’s shirt that says Property of Notre Dame]

[11:53] M: Why are we in a cemetery?
[Mumbling]
R: Yeah, why are we in a cemetery?
J: Oh! You guys may be wondering...why we’re in a creepy cemetery
JK Yeah
J: Uh, I--I don’t know why you didn’t bother to ask that on the three hour car ride up here, but I will tell you now
JK: He was driving
J: We are discussing these three films in a creepy cemetery because I just found out that I had a great-uncle...he died, but, in his will he said that, if me and three friends can stay all night in the spooky cemetery...I will get his inheritance
JK: Ohhh
J: So, we’re gonna hang out here, we’re gonna talk about these three films, and when the sun comes up, I will be a rich man...and I’ll give you all 20 bucks
[Silence]
M: And this involves taking our pants off, why?
J: Nobody asked you to take your pants off
M: I (?) was talking about on the car ride up
J: That was you, as you were doing it
M: Oh! Right, yeah. Ok
JK: Thank you, by the way for--for putting them back on
M: Yeah. It’s ok
R: [To Mike] I still have--I have bruises from when you were reaching for my belt
J: Oh my god
R: Don’t do that again
J: Was this what was going on while I was driving?
R: You were in the front seat
M: Uh, well, what was our first film?

[13:41] M: Scientist Man, who is...same actor...who played Admiral Dougherty in Star Trek Insurrection, which should be noted

[15:05] M:Get to the point!
J: [Laughs] Where’s  Kiss?
M: This is the worst Halloween ever, Jay. [Jay laughs] It’s your fault
Woman: This (?)s getting bored
J: Got that right

[15:33] [Jay and Jack laugh, camera zooms in on Mike and Rich not laughing]

[16:43] [Rich is sitting forward, rubbing his fingers’ joints (?) together while his fists are clenched] (?)
M: I’m getting more amusement watching Rich [Jay looks at Rich, then laughs] Look at him. You look like you’re waiting at the dentist’s office

[17:11] M: And it was an ill-conceived project from the get-go. It has a lot of similarities to the Star Wars Holiday Special. Some hairbrained idea, uh, some terrible idea for a tv movie, and they--the--uh--[A cloud of grey smoke appears then disappears above Mike’s head]--Rich, are you smoking?
R: No. That’s...I don’t know what that is, it’s some graveyard spookiness
M: Oh my--
J: I think it’s poltergeist
JK: Oh no. I don’t know if we’re gonna survive the haunted spooky night--
J: I hope that we can stay all night so I can get my inheritance
JK: Oh, sure, we’ll try
J: Let’s push through
M: The least haunted places are graveyards. It’s a common misconception amongst the paranormal community
J: Well, don’t tell my uncle [Pause] I guess you can't tell my uncle, ‘cause he’s dead

[18:04] M: Yeah, tv movie of the week, uhh, some stupid, stupid idea, I believe they pitched this to Kiss as, uh, A Hard Day’s Night meets Star Wars
JK: Yes
R: So, A Hard Day’s Night meets Star Wars? I--I can’t wait for...Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Amusement Park: The Force Awakens
M: I thought you were gonna say Kiss Meets the Phantom Menace
J: Ohhhhh!
R: Ohhhhh that would’ve been smarter, but I didn’t do that
M: I know [Jack laughs]
J: He David Prior-ed it
R:...I David Prior-ed it 
J: [Laughs] You took something that could be clever and amusing--[Killer Workout cover appears]--and you just did nothing with it [Rich and Jack laugh] You fundle--you fungled it

[25:55] R: If they wanted the ending to make any kind of sense, because, like, Kiss, they’re notorious sellouts, right? [Jay laughs, Mike snorts] I think--I think once--once Kiss saw like, the robots performing their songs competently, and getting the crowd riled up, they should’ve bought the robots from the robot man, then the robot man, scientist, he would’ve had all the money he wanted to build more robots
JK: Yeah
R: And Kiss would have robots that they could just send out on concerts for them, and rake in money. They could actually, like, mass produce the robots...just have concerts all over the world every fucking day….that would’ve made so much sense!
M: Yeah. And the robot man could’ve also built robots of other top rated musical acts of the time, and had giant selling con--uh, sellout concerts of, you know, The Beatles…
R: Every time a Kurt Cobain killed himself you just replace him with a new one [Jay laughs, then Rich]
M: The Kurt Cobain robots were prone to suicide
R: “This one’s startin’ to get depressed!” [Jay and Jack laugh loudly]
JK: “Jesus Christ! Keep Robo Courtney Love away from him!”
R: There’s a whole factory that’s just dedicated to pumping out fresh Cobains

[27:12] M: Are Kiss still around?
J: Yeah, they still perform. Well, two of them do
M: Kiss must be pretty old at this point. If they were still performing they would sing, “you’ll drive us wild, we’ll drive Miss Daisy” [Nobody speaks, Jay takes a sip from his bottle, then Rich laughs] Because they’re so...they’re so old [Mike looks at Rich laughing]
R: That’s good [Jay laughs] That’s good

[27:59] J: Jack? What happens in Killer Workout?
JK: Killer Workout is...a great movie, uhh…
J: But it isn’t
JK: It’s a fantastic movie
J: That’s thing, it’s not at all
JK: It’s--it’s a movie about a string of murders...that happens in a--in a--a--a place in which you work out, a gym…
J: Those are called a gym, yeah
JK: Some people call it a gym, um…
M: Some people call it a “gaim,” Homer Simpson…[A picture of Homer pops up] 
JK: A gaim, uh...an exercisatorium, um….
M: Monty Burns

[29:15] R: I think they should’ve called it The Vagina Monologues, that would’ve been a much better title
JK: Because of all of the…?--[Rich and Jack make an opening/closing gesture with their hands(?)]--legs
J: The biggest problem with the movie, though, is that there were too many monologues
M: It’s true
J: Or maybe not. Um…
JK: So--
J: But just, yeah, just dry humpin’ the air. Fuckin’ that...oxygen [Rich chuckles] 
M: So they’re oxygenating their womb space? 
J: They’re oxygenating their womb space, yeah
M: Callback! [To The Dance of Birth] Umm, yeah, no, the--the--the aerobic footage is women doing, like, aerobic moves that make no sense 
J: Yeah
M: That, uhh...that...elicit sexual acts, and it’s--it’s shocking
J: And the movie does have a choreographer, though, we should mention that
M: Yeah, it was a--a prostitute [Everyone laughs] 
R (?)
J: I was gonna say it was David A. Prior with a pseudonym 
[Plays clip of women dry humping the air]
[In the screening room, everyone laughs]
M: That is not an exercise move
J: I don’t think so
JK: These are not real moves
R: [In a girly voice] “You sure this is a real m--?” [In a gruff voice] “Yeah, yeah” [Chuckles]
JK: “Look, we got a choreographer”
J: “Just hump the ground”
M: “Kinda feels like we’re bouncing up and down on dicks” [Makes growling noise(?)]
R: That--that exercises your, uh, your lutimals [Everyone laughs]
M: “Trust me, trust me, a filmmaker” [The women finish exercising and walk off] The--they don’t call him David “Pry Your Clothes Off” for nothing

[33:40] M: Why would someone have a rubber arm in a locker room?
J: This is a wacky gym. Yeah, rubber arms, comical safety pins, this is like a, a front for some sort of clown school
R: (?) as a gym that used to be like a, like a...gag shop [Jay laughs]
JK: Someone was bludgeoned to death with a giant shoe
R: Ohh Gag Shop Murders, that’s…
J: Gag Shop…
R: That’s gotta happen

[36:43] R: Which, you know, if you’re trying to--to--to stay under the radar, you might wanna use, like, a keychain you have on you all the time as your murder weapon

[37:07] [The killer stabs a knife through the roof of a car to attack the woman inside, she keeps dodging it]
M: Lay down
J: Yeah, you know it’s gonna keep coming
M: Go out of range of the knife [Jay laughs]
JH: Or just...it’s for--it’s for your own good
J: Yeah
M: Why don’t you move? Oh, fuck it (?)
[The killer manages to kill the woman through the roof of the car]
J: She deserved to die

[37:24] R: (?) more...more--more gym-themed kills, like, has anybody’s head ever been crushed by a ThighMaster? [Jack wheezes] Has that happened?
JK: Just stick someone’s head between Suzanne Somers and see what happens

[37:52] JK: This movie should be retitled to “Just The Worst Cop”
J: Though we discovered…
M: Or “Incopetent”?
R: Ohhhh
J: Incompetent [Rich and Mike high five, Jack raises his fists] That’s great

[38:42] J: At no point, uh, proclaiming that you’re a cop…
JK: Yeah
J: Just--just pound on the door and say “I want in your apartment!”
JK: Right
J: “Let me in!”
R: “Cop Smash!”

[41:07] J: I think that was something that was created in editing, though. I--I think that this was, uh...uh, they realized that the movie was sort of boring, so they’re like “l--we have all this aerobics footage, let’s just keep cutting back to that once in a while.” So, in the movie as it was shot, they were probably not supposed to still be open, but they just were like, “well, this is boring, just show some more boobs.” So they just cut to that
JK: Worked like a charm
J: Yeah
M: It’s like the bird in Citizen Kane
[Plays clip]
J: The parakeet? Where it’s like raa--it’s like a scene transition, right?
M: Well, it was meant to wake the audience up
[Pause]
J: Like for real?
M: Yes. The producer thought it was...the film...people would be sleeping...in the theater, so he said, “Orson Welles, you gotta cut in this bird and squawk to wake the audience up”
J: Okay
M: It’s true, that’s--it’s a fact
JK: Wow--[Mike squawks]

[42:20] [A woman unzips her hoodie, revealing that her boobs have been burnt, everybody laughs]
JK: Yaaaay!
M: “I’ve got Freddy Krueger tits!”
JH: Fucks sake…
J: She was--she was completely engulfed in flames...at the beginning of this movie, and she was face down!
JK: But her shoulders aren’t burned, it’s just her tits? [Mike huffs, Rich laughs]
J: So literally the only thing that’s burned on her body is her boobs? She has Freddy Krueger boobs?
R: That’s--75 percent of her body, those are some big boobs [Everyone laughs] 
M: “Only my tits were burned up…”
J: Yeah. Ever--everything is burned except for what we see at any given time
R: “My career is over, I’m a woman” [After a second Jay and Rich laugh]
J: That was a joke about sexism, I can understand that
M: Okay, it was about sexism?
R: Yes
J: Yeah
M: Alright
J: That works

[44:20] M: Rich, you look embarrassed for this

[46:25] J: This movie has brain damage

[51:33] R: Lots of vaginas tonight [Silence] Just sayin’ [Jay and Jack laugh] Eating--eating vagina babies in this one, we’ve got floppy exercise vaginas….
J: [Laughing] Floppy exercise…
R: And in the Kiss movie we got--we got the--the cat man, who’s kind of a pussy, so….[Jay and Jack laugh] 

[58:12] J: He knocked over one of the tombstones
M: It’s all right. That person’s long dead
