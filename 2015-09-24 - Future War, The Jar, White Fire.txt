Hey, Mike.
Oh.
Hey, Josh.
How are you?
I’m, I’m great.
How are you doing?
I’m doing great.
Good.
It’s been a while since we’ve seen you.
Yeah, I’ve been away long enough that you’ve built these cool new shelves.
Yeah.
And, uh, you’ve got 'em all set apart in all these different, uh, genres. 
All organized in these genres.
That’s really cool.
Oh, no.
Did you say genres?
Well, I had a pot of coffee, and I’m ready to talk about what films we’re gonna watch today.
Great.
And I thought since we had them organized into their own spots, that we could pull one from each genre.
Oh, yeah, like action, sci-fi, and horror?.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
How about these?
Those look great.
Although they were all on the same shelf.
Our first film is Future War.
*Movie #1 Future War*
M: Oh my god, my favorite actor is in it, Daniel Bernhardt
JH: He...is from………
M: He is..…he has a name [Looks at the tape] Uhh…
JH: [Chuckles] I’m not convinced anymore
M: He is from such classic films as….and…...and, my favorite…..[Josh nods] Also, Robert Z’Dar is in this
JH: Oh my--
M: And we all love Robert Z’Dar
JH: Rest in peace
M: Rest in peace
JH: He is missed
M: “It came from the future to hunt humans.” [Silence] Umm….[Points to the cover] And then this looks like Jean-Claude Van Damme. And then there’s two cyborg-looking characters. I’m going to guess none of this is in the film
JH: Good guess
M: Or Robert Z’Dar photoshopped onto a borg costume. Okay, and the--well, let me start with the special features [Josh laughs] “Special Features: Movie”
JH: Oh
M: “No one is safe in this deadly sci-fi tale of a master race of cyborgs from the future who abduct humans from the past breeding them as slaves”
JH:...Okay
M: Apparently no one’s safe from punctuation
JH: Hmm
M: “Bloodthirsty dinosaurs….” Oh my god 
JH: Woah, okay
M: “...are trained as trackers, impossible to outrun. But when a human (Daniel Bernhardt)......”
JH: Natural
M: “...breaks free, a blood war begins, and the cyborgs are forced to battle against vigilantes, street gangs, and drug lords”
JH: [Chuckles] This kinda--
M: “In a deadly race for the future”
JH: That kinda sounds amazing
M: [Opens the case] So, uh, this is a winner...I hope
JH: Oh wow, look at the fancy…disc
M: They hired top graphic artists on this project
JH: I’m almost just impressed they didn’t just sharpie the name on the--
M: Well, maybe someone did, they just spent a really long time doing it
JH: Did a really good job

[3:50] Jack: Is that supposed to be a pit? I believe that is supposed to be a pit. They couldn’t afford an actual pit 
JH: Oh
JK: So they’re not showing the pit [Jay laughs, Josh groans] They couldn’t afford to dig a hole

[4:58] M: What’s next, Josh?
JH: [Grabs the next tape] The Looooove Butcher! Uh, “he wants more than your love” [Mike looks at the camera] He wants success in his field?
M: Oh, yeah
JH: Yes
M: I--I’m wondering if that fucking tape will even play. It looks like it’s been through a--a nuclear explosion
JH: [Inspects the case] Woooow [Opens the case]
M: It’s like a post-apocalyptic VHS tape
JH: [Laughs] It’s just--it’s just a--
M: Yeah. And someone has (?) printed (?) marker, on the spine
JH: Oh. Oh
M: Again, this may be a handwritten label, like our last film
JH: That’s impressive
M: [Stutters] The VHS tape will start, like, turning into dust the second we hit play
*10 Minutes Later*
JH: [Sighs] So we tried to watch The Love Butcher
M: But it butchered our VCR
JH: [Picks up the VCR] You see this? Right here? [Lifts the flap, the tape is stuck inside] Look--look in there, you see that? That’s the fucking Love Butcher. We can’t even get it out of the fucking VCR
M: Talk about overstaying its welcome [Josh groans, Mike throws the case high over his shoulder]
JH: So instead...we’re going to watch The Jar!
*Movie #2 The Jar*
JH: “It blows the lid off terror!”
M: It certainly blows….[Silence] What is that, a jar full of...cum?
JH: Look, there’s a little guy...a guy in there
M: Oh yeah...it’s a little goblin in there….it’s classified as horror, it’s rated R
JH: Uh, oh yeah, ey, yep
M: All things are good so far
JH: Let me tell you about The Jar
M: All right
JH: Okay
M: You tell me
JH: Okay
JK: [In the back] You guys just rhymed three times in a row
Mike and Josh: We did? [Jay laughs]
JK: That’s really great
[The footage rewinds]
M: It’s rated R--good so far
JH: Let me tell you about The Jar
[Back in the present]
M: Ohhhh
JH: I feel like a regular Nipsey Russell
M: Alright…
JH: Alright, “Paul, once an easygoing guy, has just experienced the shock of his life. And now he’s gone absolutely craaaazy!”
M: Oh my gaaawwwwd
JH: “He’s just come face to face--” ooh, excuse me, that--that one’s tough, let me do that again
M: Just came on a face, what?
JH: “He’s just come face to gruesome face with a repulsive embryonic creature he discovered in a jar! And it looks like it’s out to get him”
M: [Unimpressed] Oh…
JH: “He can’t get hold of himself and those bizarre nightmares are really getting on his nerves! He’s not even paying attention to his beautiful neighbor Crystal, and that’s not normal! It’s that thing in the jar that’s to blame. But for some reason he just can’t seem to get rid of it.” Hm!
M: Crystal or the thing in the jar?
JH: I don't’ know. “It’s already made his life miserable and now it wants to kill him! Boy, does Paul have a monster of a problem!” [Pause] Wow, it actually says that?
M: Crystal has a monster of a problem. His name is Paul

[7:42] [The screen is completely black]
*30 seconds into the movie*
Voice: I--I--I--I--I
J: It’s Shoji Tabuchi

[8:02] JK: This is--this is someone’s college...fi--film school film
[“The Jar” appears on screen, everyone bursts into laughter]

[8:11] JH: “Music composed and performed by Obscure Sighs”
M: Obscure what?
JH: Sighs. Like--[Sighs]
M: Oh, “sighs”
JH: Yeah
M: (?)
JH: No, no. “Sighs” like Obscure Sighs, as opposed to those common sighs that we all know about
M: I’ve never heard of Obscure Sighs. They must be very, very…..forgettable [Josh stares then looks at the case] 

[9:14] M: What’s our next film? [Grabs the last tape] White Fang. Starring Robert Ginty
JH: Ohhhh Robert Ginty!
M: This is the strangest adaptation of a Jack London novel I’ve ever seen, I don’t remember a chainsaw in it. Oh, sorry, White Fire
JH: Ohhhh! Oh
*Movie #3 White Fire*
M: Umm [Reads the tagline] “extermination is the reward for the World’s richest prize”? [Silence, Mike looks around] Does that make any sense?
JH: Well, here is where it makes sense, you remember how that guy was The Exterminator?
M: Yes
JH: You remember? Are you sure?
M: Oh, it’s a callback to that?
JH: And then the rest of it’s just words
M: “Extermination is the reward for the World’s richest prize,”  did I just have a stroke--
JH: No
M: Or does that say that?
JH: It’s f....it’s what it says, “extermination is the reward for the World’s richest prize,” which means that the world’s richest prize is going to be exterminated [Pause]
M: I don’t--
JH: That’s how I read that
M: Okay [Looks at the case, chuckles] That doesn’t make any sense to me
JH: It--no, it--no, it’s...fucking….
M: Uh, White Fire…..91 minutes
JH: [Deflates with relief] Oh thank God
M: That’s the most important information
JH: It’s very important
M: [Reads the back] “The legendary 200 carat White Fire diamond is so brilliant that is burns at the touch”
JH: [Shakes his head] No
M: Well, “it’s also the target of smugglers and thieves the world over”
JH: That makes sense
M: Yes. Not if you’re--you have to have gloves, though
JH: Well, sure
M: If you wanna touch it
JH: Yeah
M: “The elusive gem has been uncovered in Istanbul, and adventurer Beau Donnelly and his sister conspire to make this heist their grand exit from a highly successful career in international diamond smuggling”
JH: Sure! Because, yeah, if you...have a diamond that literally burns to the touch….you--you--you’ve wrapped it up
M: You gotta retire after that. And who doesn’t have a successful career in international diamond smuggling? [Josh laughs] “I’m an international diamond smuggler, but, you know, I’m living on (?) day to day.” Yeah. “Trying to pay the rent” [Josh laughs] Yea--yeah
JK: Diamond--diamond smuggling is more of a hobby for you?
M: It’s more of a hobby
JH: Yeah
JK: [Says something in the background] (?)
 JH: I a--
M: Work at a gas station during the day
JH: Always wanted to turn it into a career, but I just didn’t know how to--how to take it up the next level
M: Sm--smuggle very small diamonds
JH: Hmm-mhm
M: [Barely audible] Very small diamonds. They’re easier to smuggle [Points to the chainsaw on the cover] Do you think Robert Ginty will actually stab anyone with this chainsaw?
JH: A--a person?
M: Yeah
JH: No
M: Okay
JH: No. I think he might take apart some property
M: Do you think there will even be a diamond in this movie? [Josh furrows his eyebrows and stares at the tape] It’ll be about a cyborg or something [Josh laughs] The box is lying to us. But when they get the world’s richest prize we know that their reward will be extermination
JH: Hmm-mhm
M: [Almost laughing] And so our reward be (?) Sorry

[14:45] JK: Did you--did you hear that door sound effect?
M: Yeah, I have that sound 
JK: What? Yeah, but--the door didn’t open
M: Some...things happened elsewhere
JH: Somebody used a door
[At the table]
M: It’s a--it’s a door sound effect, and we all have it. This is it [Opening door sound effect plays] And it’s in the film

[17:56] J: This is what we got for our Terminator rip-off, a bunch of boxes

[18:11] R: This movie...it was when we learned this movie has “set-lexia”
M: Yeah
JH: Yes
R: Because he’s outside the boxes, and then, with no transition, suddenly they’re inside with boxes. And then suddenly there’s plastic everywhere and everything is now cold, for some reason, and I’m not sure whether or not the plastic is supposed to be ice. I’m not convinced

[19:17] JH: Um, but really this does kind of bring around what we felt the overall movie was, was a...a child’s fight scenario shot on a 17 dollar budget

[19:52] M: It’s amazing how--how this looks like a child made it
JH: Yeah
R: It’s little Timmy, he’s making his own Terminator!
JH: Yeah
R: Only this one’s got dinosaurs!
J: [At the same time Rich speaks] “You know what Terminator needed? It needed dinothaurs”
JH: Yeah! [Laughs] Yayyyyy 
J: “Let’s put some dinothaurs in the movie”
JH: “Good idea”
R: “I like t-rexes, put a t-rex in the movie”
M: Was the movie made around the fact that they had a couple of...robotic dinosaurs…?
J: Which came first, the concept or the dinosaur puppets?

[26:55] M: It’s an amazing film
J: Yes
JH: Yeah. It’s ambitious, and it’s adorable, and they just--they tried their asses off
J: Yeah. And failed horribly
JH: Oh yeah
J: To our benefit
JH: Yeah
M: It’s amazing grownups made this movie

[27:40] R: I--I ju--I just wanna stress something, we really loved Future War, a--a great, great film, just...after watching Future War, just something, something sucked all of the life out of us
JH: Oh, what was that?
R: Th--the second movie we watched…[Picks up the tape] was The Jar. Mike, would you tell us about The Jar, because fuck you?
J: [Laughs] Wow!
M: Wow, okay, well…
J: Wow
M: That’s fair. That’s fair [Josh giggles] Uh….[Looks over the tape] The Jar, “it blows…...the lid off terror”
J: No, you didn’t need to continue

[29:39] R: This is some jackass filming a bunch of random abstract shit, and then I’m sure he went around saying “you bring your own interpretation to it” after he showed it to people
M: Maybe
[Dark red/brown liquid flows out of a bathtub drain]
JH: Whyyy is my tub full of soouuup

[32:30] [Quickly zooms in on Rich]
R: Fuck off!

[33:48] M: Hanging on a cross ain’t so bad right now
R: (?) make a movie where somebody’s trying to escape from a college art movie?

[35:11] M: Well, I was gonna make a joke
JH: You what? (?)
M: That this film is...is, is piss...it’s Jacob’s Bladder

[35:33] R: You watch this movie, “urine” trouble
M: Urine trouble? [Jay laughs] Rich, that was really good
R: Thank you, thank you
M: You’re starting to learn how to make good puns
JH: A Team Blue thing?
J: I think it’s a Team Blue thing, we can’t understand
R:...we get a point [Points upward] pling!
M: [Points at Jay and Josh] Team Blue forever! Team Gree--Green sucks, right, Rich?
R: Yeah, boo Green, boo Green!

[36:01] J: There’s nothing funny bad in this
M: No
J: And there’s nothing interesting
JH: [Almost disagrees] Ahh--uh
R: No!....[Wags his finger at Josh to scold him] No! No!

[37:51] [Rich grabs The Jar and hits it repeatedly on the table]
J: Oh my gawwwd
M: Oh Jesus [Rich throws the tape away]
J: Oh. Oh. Oh
M: Usually we save that for the end
R: I couldn’t help it
M: I understand. Believe me

[38:16] R: Our final movie of the night...is called White Fire. Josh! 
JH: Yesss
R: [Puts the tape in front of Josh] Take us away!
JH: Okay!
R: Take us away from The Jar!
JH: White Fire is a 91 minute treatise on incest, couched (?) in a heist movie

[40:38] JH: Um, and don’t forget, uh, the other guy that, uh, gets caught stealing diamonds, and then gets tortured to death by a young George Lucas
J: Hmm-mhm
[Man screams in agony then dies]
R: Turkish...George Lucas
J: Turkish George Lucas...[Josh begins to say something] who directed Turkish Star Wars
JH: There’s young George Lucas and Old Turkish George Lucas, there are two George Lucases
J: [Chuckling] There’s two George Lucases....
R: Are there two George Lucases?
JH: Yeah
J: Yes
JH: Yeah
R: Oh my gawwd! [Josh and Jay laugh]
JH: It’s--it’s a country that’s full of George Lucases--[Jay laughs]--and I never want to go to there
R: And--and Mario
JH: And Mario(?)
J: Everybody’s Mario in this movie. Everybody has the same mustache 
[Mario theme song plays over clips of Turkish actors from the movie that all have the same mustache]

[41:53] M: “You wanted to put that in my sister? That’s my job” [Everyone laughs] Is what Robert Ginty said

[42:33] M: It’s a--it’s a weird, weird--it’s not an Oedipus complex, it’s a Sister-pus complex [Jay laughs] I really don’t even know--
R: He’s got a complex with his sister’s puss

[43:55] JH: So then the bad guys show up, and they fuckin’ blow a blow dart in her skull, and she dies
J: Well, no, they--they actually--they blow a, uh, a golf tee into her forehead
JH: Ohh yeah
[A golf tee-shaped blow dart strikes the sister in the forehead, camera zooms in on it, golf ball falling into hole and clapping sound effects are heard]
R: It went into her “fore” head?

[44:33] [Robert Ginty goes to caress the dead sister’s face]
JK: [As Robert Ginty] “I was gonna fuck her!”

[45:17] R: Should we play a game? The--the “what emotion is Robert Ginty expressing?” game?

[46:01] M: Well, first he offers her 50 thousand dollars--
JH: Yeah
M: He’s like “you wanna earn $50,000?” and she says “who do I have to fuck?”
Guy: Would...you be interested in...making $50,000
Lady: Yeah, I’d be interested in making $50,000. Who do I have to lay?
JH: “So seriously, who am I fuckin’?” [Jay laughs]
JK: “For 50, it’s you--either one of you’s fine”
JH: I--it’s good
[Silence]
JK: “Actually, I prefer the old guy, he seems like he might give a little more effort. [Jay laughs] No offense, Ginty...you don’t look like a giver” (?)
[At the table] 
JH: This prostitute, and she--that’s--that’s where it becomes clear that she is a prostitute…
J: Yes
(?): Yeah
JH: Because she could’ve been in the bar, she could’ve been just some lady that wanted to have sex with Robert Ginty which, I’ll grant you, is not believable, but….it’s a movie--[Rich giggles]--it’s a movie…..but so, it--it’s established that she’s a prostitute and she can probably just go ahead and drop out of whatever life she’s having for $50,000 to act like his sister, and then eventually get plastic surgery to look exactly like his sister
M: Is this a prequel to Face/Off? [Jay laughs, Josh groans] I--I wanna John Woo my sister
R: Wah wah [Couple seconds go by] Mike, you’re punishing me [Mike and Jay laugh, Mike and Rich high five]

[47:49] J: But they hire this prostitute that looks kind of like his sister, to take the place of the sister, and they give her plastic surgery to look like the sister...supposedly so she can infiltrate
JH: Yes
J: But it’s more because Robert Ginty wants to fuck his sister
JH: Exactly, during the time--
M: No, Robert Ginty wants to infiltrate his sister. You gotta use the right pronouns
J: I’m sorry, I’m sorry
M:....That’s not even right,  you gotta use the right verbs

[53:14] R: The whole movie is essentially the director’s safe(?) incest fantasy
J: Yeah
JH: Which...nothing really gets heisted and nothing really happens
J: And it’s just a….
R: [As the director] “Film some more scenes with the sister!”
(...)
J: “Stare at her tits, Ginty!”
R: “Take your clothes off and get back in the pool! [Jay laughs] I like it when you’re wet!” [Jay and Josh laugh]
M: Were you doing, like, an impression or was it something you said before? [Pause]
R: No, it was an impression, of the director, not myself
M: [Delicately (?)] Oh! [Tries not to laugh] I couldn’t keep a straight face

[56:51] R: I think we’re all pretty much universal on The Jar as the, the--just--the--destruction [Mike nods] I think we need to “pickle”...The Jar
[Nobody speaks, Jay knocks the tape down] 
M: But you don’t pickle a jar [Background music stops] 

[57:08] [Scientist Man walks into the frame]
SM: Hello. I’m Scientist Man And in today’s experiment, we have…[Indicates each item] a jar...The Jar...and a jar of acetone. What is acetone, you ask? [Puts his hand in his pocket to take something out] Let me answer that qui--[Struggles to open up a piece of paper] “Acetone...systematically named pro...propanil...is the organic compound with the formula C something C H 3 twenah--[Waves his hand]--is a colorless volatile flammable liquid….Acetone is mis...mis(?) with water and serves as an important solvent in its own right. Typically for cleaning purposes and (?). Mainly used as a solvent in production of...methyl...methyl acrylate and bisa--a. Bisfenol a. It is a solvent produced a common building block…[Voice overlaps (?)] It’s in many sub synthetic (?) [Crumples the paper and throws it over his shoulder] Let’s begin the experiment...oh! [Looks around] Let’s begin--oh! [Continues looking around] [Puts the tape in the jar] Next we’ll take our acetone [Puts the acetone next to the jar] Remember: always wear safety goglies and rubbly gluuvs. I’m now going to put the acetone in the jar with The Jar [Pours the acetone on The Jar] Oh jeez, I spilled it all over the table. Remember to pour it carefully as it’s currently eating away my glove. [Continues pouring] I just splashed it all over my crotch. God, it fucking stinks [After filling it to the top] That seems to be enough acetone. I will now place the lid on the jar [The lid makes acetone spill out] Oh, fuck me! It’s a good thing this isn’t highly flammable [Disclaimer: Acetone is highly flammable appears on screen for half a second] (?) but a fraud. I’m gonna go wash off my crotch. It’s getting all over my shoes [Takes off his gloves and walks away] Fucking...shouldn’t have dropped out of scientist school. Ow, it’s burning in my eyes, I think I got some--[Walks into a pole, squeaky door opening sound effect plays]--oh, fuck!
