normal is this how your tree normally
looks oh yeah it's all year round yes I
have a permit tree good job where Jevons
so why actually is it covered in skulls
well this year on Halloween October 31st
we had a massive Blizzard in Milwaukee
so it kind of felt like Christmas on
Halloween so this year we decided to
bring Halloween to Christmas and we're
calling this a very scary Christmas well
you probably had extra decorations too
that's really probably why
oh no we made rich go out and find all
this stuff in December we're gonna watch
a hat we're gonna watch a Halloween
movie or a Christmas movie we're gonna
watch very scary Christmas movies either

made by the co-creator of Night of the
Living Dead the horror classic well it

co-creator of core classic kind of the
Living God really they put that I hung I

psychotic desire Santa Claus mercilessly

and the object of his psychotic desire
the red-suited maniac tracks Raven down
to the set of her latest erotic horror
movie leading to a shocking
confrontation between Raven and this
unstoppable monster that will have you
shivering with fear god that was really
hard to read so this is kind of like a
less sexy version of the fanatic with
John Travolta I tried to calm him down
he said listen mister I'm just like
anyone else I'm just a regular person
like you and he wouldn't hear it he kept
telling me over and over and over again
I probably would stop a bullet for me
does that mean you'd add me yeah that's
news trying to say but you know he was
just drunk on eating me
producer Bruce friends wait no one's
heard from him since he did that shoot
with little Brittany it's like they both
to say it be great if lay the tape broke
yeah alright ooh let it be good this is
a little heavier I think it's a VHS it's
ice-t's starring Rob Van Winkle
Merry Christmas but it does sour
oncology oh it sounds like some sort of
like medical oncologist yeah alright
what he got what do we got here well
this isn't a Christmas movie but it's it
appears to be some sort of ski slasher
ooh a downhill vacation becomes a
nightmare of terror get off the hill
before you get Iced well this is the
back of the box I wish that was a
no-good hot-blooded couples on a cold
blooded weekend and they're dying to ski
Jesus Christ what's going on in this
bottom picture here it looks like she's
got like an ice cream scoop
it's like scooping out his heart or
something Cory and Jeff are hot for
Trina and itching for a fight they
devised the ultimate duel a midnight
race down perilous ski slopes but when
Jeff careens off the mountain and is
impaled on the rocks below his gruesome
death shatters the circle of friends
sounds like they weren't that close to
begin yeah they're already bickering
yeah every bickering over for over some
lady hmm years go by in the nightmare
fades then the members of the circle are
mysteriously invited back to the same
resort they're thrilled to be together
it's like old times
reckless skiing and untamed sex just
like old times all that untamed sex with
with our tiny circle of friends pass
each other around mm-hmm
but passion turns into panic I almost
thought that said passion turns pathetic
the peshan turns into panic when eerie
reminders of the past surface and they
discover someone spying on them
stock Raisa distich hunter with a
twisted mind only one of them will
survive

him on a blind journey of a relentless
revenge leading ultimately to Mother
Superior and when he gets to her not
even her faith will be enough to stop
Ricky as he follows her in the family

horrifying the scariest part was when we
realized we had another movie to watch

start with creepy and I could think of
no one else other than rich yes yeah the

not do you not do not abuse me enough in
your day-to-day life you just call me
John Russo alright this is a fine
Christmas film about a pornography
studio one of the actresses has a a
creepy neighbor who's kind of obsessed
with her and stalking her
he just coincidentally lives next to her
she's the the the most prominent b-movie
actress in Akron Ohio Debbie Rowe called
it say yeah I played by b-movie scream
queen Debbie rashon who's been in 527
film call us back she's usually very
good I've seen plenty of movies with her
where she's good and she's sleeping her
way through this boy howdy I guess I
just got used to it more and more as
time went on you know just got used to
the business
I enjoy being called scream queen now
she's dead with completely vacant eyes
yep
you know I must have the weirdest resume
in the whole world man they sure don't
make them like this well this is the
first film we learned that vicodin could
act it's really good Vikings really good
at acting yeah I think the drugs they
slipped those little kids to make him
pass out that's what Debbie rashon was
taking well I got something in my purse
survelliance but we did should mention
that the movie is directed by John Russo
co-creator of Night of the Living Dead
the oh you never heard about the the guy
you made that movie with knighted Living
Dead he made it with this guy named
George Romero you never heard of it yeah
exactly who's he but you know John Bruce
because when you think I deliver did you
think of John Russo exactly two younger
brothers direct some great Avengers
that's true yeah channel 9 showbiz news
and I'm talking with Bruce Brunswick
publisher of girlie magazines and
producer Oh what is commonly called T&A
videos whether you realize it or not
Diane there's a huge market for the
stuff we're more movies ahead of its
time
news story right all right so our movie
opens up with the local news station
doing the report at support at the porno
porno film yeah 4 by 5 foot blue wall
report on such an event
oh yeah it's topical maybe the Christmas
porno get the news crew on something's
going on in New York
it's September 11th something's going on
in New York we got a bigger story in
Pittsburgh so we get that uncover this
thing that's going on in New York
everyone don't forget about that in a
week they're filming a porno
a softcore porno is it even considered
porn when it's just someone just kind of
dancing in one spot writhing in pain
it's just like go-go day
same basically it's just sleaze yeah one
of the things I appreciate about this
movie is that they more than once
explained what pornography is that's
yeah yeah just oh right for the
layperson the girls have beautiful
bodies and normal healthy guys enjoy
looking at their they're approaching it
from the perspective that the general
audience has never seen a naked woman
yes and why yeah why do I want to look
at naked women oh the movie told me that
it's new to the general public this new
this new form of entertainment men will
really enjoy it's a lady the little
girls bomb who gets stabbed to death in
night of Living Dead is in this film as
grandma
yeah Marilyn Eastman is in this film
that very pleasant Greg yeah that
awkward scene shot the living room
that's like like three foot by three
foot mm-hmm with all the dolls
there's just dog is so creepy that's
like John Russo's living room all
couples argue and there's nothing wrong
between us it can't be fixed
especially if his loving mother and
adoring sister would learn to butt out
well that was an inappropriate use of a
snap zoom everybody's mad at Debbie
rashon for her porno career
her, her husband, Joey Buttafuoco, he fled town to Akron
her husband's a, an erotic photographer
that's how they, that's how they met
that's how they met
yes
yes
and he's off in a photo shoot
which is just an excuse to fuck
other than my wife, you're the first one since I've been married
yeah, I'm not gonna believe that either
he's our hero, by the way
this sleazy italian man, who is cheating on his wife
who's at home with two kids
this is our hero
he's abandoned his children to have sex with someone in Akron, Ohio
rich, tell us all about Wayne
Wayne we meet Wayne what was this shrine
like accurate compared to like the weird
ones you have looks a lot like the
shrine you have for me in your house it
doesn't it doesn't have the the creepy
real towel bust of me okay yes you're
making I saw you making one paper mache
there's didn't have arms or a bottom
mine does that's the creepy thing about
the doll in this movie it doesn't have
arms but it's not like it's just a bust
that doesn't have arms it's like the
arms were ripped off shatters they're
jagged edges yeah it's like it was a
mannequin at a store or something and he
got it at a discount sale and not to be
confused with the mannequin that's in
the dressing room at the porno this is
the studio that looks like a person
person it might be
oh she's pretending to be a dummy wait
what
that's a river Shawn she's gonna stab
her know that wall looks to bear we need
a prop Samantha's like like she was
gonna be the killer and at some point it
looks very realistic but it's low
quality video yeah so you know in what
shop and film we should point out about
it yeah was it though was it I mean it
was have a shot on film a shot on film
shot on filthy film
there's hairs in the gate throughout the whole thing
that's John Russo's pubes
hey, hey
it's fucking disgusting
allegedly
allegedly
there's like 40
minutes of Wayne worshipping that real
go over another in case we didn't get
that he's creepy and obsessed by the way
wait is creepy and obsessed yeah did you
get it yet
and then he wants her to spend more time with him
so then, so he decided to start killing, like, the director of her movie
and everyone involved in the movie
no, no
how
was that, was that his motive
how does he kill
we're getting to it
his victims
oh, we're getting to it
okay
so he uses a, a fucking, it looks like a gardening tool
a dollar store gardening tool
like a gardening for
this is the titular Santa Claus Santa
Claus I think I'm like a Freddy glove
kind of it's just a Darby to things
aren't even super sharp oh look there on
the plastic chair man
oh this is so pathetic Wow Wow he may as
well be using a spork yeah garden weasel
was born to me true nothing spins
there's all sorts of sharp edges on
thank God we learn how he got his Santa
suit and the better scene in the film
yes that's the that's uh yellow we see
ya in Silent Night deadly night - and
this film we see where they got their
Santa suit done much more effectively in
Silent Night deadly night - in this film
he goes to a costume store and he buys
it we watch it in excruciating detail
goes to a Salvation Army guy on the
corner oh and he asked and he asked him
where did you get your suit why don't
you just beat up that guy in stealing
fun good what you should Santa Claus
yeah yeah kill the guys they're like
that's just ready to see where he
exchanges money it's like the setup there is obvious, right
like a, like a two-year old would know how to handle that scene, right
yeah, right
no, you fucking kill the guy
you kill Santa, you take his suit
bad-a-bing, bad-a-boom
like, a two-year old would know how
then he kills the man, and takes his suit
that would
it's just
yes
rich, are you questioning the creative decisions of the man who co-created Night of the Living Dead
he's the one that they didn't get the copyright, isn't he
he's the same man who gives our killer a mask, then hides his identity, only firm to reveal himself the very first scene he appears in
yeah
that's the other weird thing
it's, it's never a mystery but why is he wearing an old
black mask that's that's a mystery set
up ya know exactly because it's like
okay even if there's not a twist at the
end you're setting up the fact that like
oh like we'd be sitting there the whole
going oh it really could be Harry's are
here exactly
no, no
it's lame
no he's creepy
he's halfway through his murder, he takes off his mask, finishes the murder, and then they do that thing with a silhouette
oh, yeah
where he's putting his mask on
it's like, oh that's
that's mysterious
I wonder who the killer is
I wonder who the fucking killer is
I have a crazy theory, but I think this movie was made so the director could film naked ladies
I'm not sure, but
well, it shows it shows the level of their creativity when it's like
yeah the title of Santa Claus what are
claw oh here's a gardening tool just use
that that's kind of like claws and then
they're like oh it's a b-movie we gotta
have boobs in it how do we get boobs in
the movie they're just naked ladies
there and that's that's as far as it
went oh there's a guy that's obsessed
with her how does he get access to her
so easily I just lives next door maybe
since the kids and drugs and leaves to
kill people that aren't related to her
at all they just also happen to work on
the porno see this feels like the setup
for a porno yeah that in fight scene is
the most amazing in fight scene I've
ever seen in my entire life oh that
stare sequence the guy he's got a
gardening tool sort of sharp
the most pathetic slasher that's another
connection to Silent Night deadly night
- right people falling downstairs people
falling those stairs and it's the exact
same framing exactly Exorcist same movie
why don't you decide to start dressing
like Santa Claus exactly that's the
title of the film no reason koosy ask
the Salvation Army guy we're to buy a
costume is just a spur-of-the-moment
idea and we watched every step of the
purchase everything you know we have to
see all the details of how he becomes
what he becomes a batman begins to
or else it wouldn't have made any fucking sense yeah if it wasn't for that
scene I would have so many questions
about this film mm-hmm this movie sucks
balls up honestly yes it was Engel balls
I mean you were suffering the most its
bottom of the barrel and in terms of
like ideas it's the bare minimum it
sucked all the air out of the room and
mm-hmm what little air was left in the
room was sucked out by ice we were in a
total vacuum
that would even go through them I love
you
so who wants talking about ice ice ice
ice baby it's an anagram for dice that's
fun to roll we're keeping that in so ice
about a group of friends and like it
starts with a young group of friends and
they aren't ski resorts kind of thing at
nights and I don't know a bit and when
it's flares good guy is talking to a
lady and a bad guy comes in and says I
you know I that's my lady no you back
off she's with me
his good guy good guys the one who's
like perpetually drunk through the whole
movie right he was born without a liver
doesn't want to discuss this any further
right now 250 grand price today they got
in this thing shouldn't make it too hard
to resist they have a ski off
perfect I guess good guy wins yeah and
also then we end up going back to look
the the cabin and a lot kind of stuff
it's a it's a party it's a it's a
raucous party with like backwards hat
guy I know that guy's got the way he's
gonna let you know he's the comic relief
yeah he's Jughead listen feels like
you're watching that's not a fantasy
the tribe not the best director of
photography you know everybody's drunk
and I'm talking about the filmmakers yes
it's a crazy 80s party yes yeah it is I
think this was made in the 90s
I know but really sad but it's still
crazy whoa bring up a little booze
that's true yeah this is a very I think
it was mainly IDs but it's a very 80s
movie there's so many so many scenes of
coke and the spills everywhere
somebody's in the coke - yeah there was
97 coke yes there was pee gonna go
another bump we get a very intense
confrontation bad guy goes into a good
guy in girls room and that's where we
get the famous line well no and then he
drunkenly goes into his room and he
grabs one of his what is it gold yes he
pulls but then when he goes outside he
has both of them that's kind of new here
just-just what's fine then he bumps into
people for no reason--watch yeah
everybody's just drunk his whole film to
walk anybody but the important part
about storming into the room is is the
lady the love triangle yeah he said you
came with me you know why you're with
him with anybody I don't like yeah yeah
and then she came with him yes oh well
she did yeah they had some some sexual
intercourse yeah honestly that sex scene
is probably the most graphic one
everything that we saw like I mean just
listen there's some man butts in this
this man but doesn't you see you see a
dong or two but not like a full dong you
see a helmet or two is when you see like
a third of a ball you'd almost mistake
this for a David Dakota movie I know
there the director had a fan of fancy
for male bucks
I guess because remember the guy who was
the coke addict who looks like Jude Law
he he for no reason has a shower in he's
nude yeah he's doing cold he's doing
coke in the bathroom completely naked
within the but but it turns out to be a
dream a nightmare dream / there's a
number of weird we don't know if they're
psychic visions of yes yeah what was it
half a dream or half not like was he
doing coke in the bathroom and then like
you know would just sleep and then he
dreamt about him he's dead body in the
bed which doesn't pay off later but it's
like he's fantasizing about making out
with the woman in the tub while he's
making out with her on the bed yeah and
it's really weird
boy I'd rather be doing this in the top
yeah they were making out in the bed
they were making out in the middle of
the room by the fireplace standing
around watching yeah oh yeah yeah it's
cuz everybody's drunk nobody cares
Oh Oh No
it did say I pay a lot of rock so so the
bad guy decides drunkenly ski goes down
the mountain aw it's tough and then boom
four years later all of the friends from
the beginning of the movie they're
invited four years later one of them
gets run over by a truck immediately a
bulldozer bulldozer within like a couple
of minutes he comes feet and he can't
get up he comes to the previous school
of running away from boom he
disintegrates there's mustache man he's
gone honestly when I say he just
integrates I make it sound a lot more
interesting and it really is yes run
over so hard he turns into his own pants
pants and ketchup
pretty much just a bunch of ketchup
packets in his pants he's actually alive
he just ran away the cutscene he's the
killer in a stew oh yeah The Reckoning
resurrection is it iced tea oh oh mmm
he wants revenge against the real estate
agents family because his nuts got
frostbitten office he had to run away
without his pants he lost his valuable
collection of ketchup packets but most
importantly I lost my ketchup
he had one from every fast-food chain I
kept him in his cargo pants some of
those dated back to the 1950s
yeah
he had the very first McDonald's ketchup packet, and it's a worth
Roy crock gave it to himself
yeah
and it got splattered on that snowy ground that one fateful day
we're fucking desperate
we're fucking desperate
but those pants weren't cheap
none of the characters were identifiable, except we're like, old mustache guy
yeah
first guy they kill
he's gone, and then everybody just looks the same
he's gone in like, two minutes
and then you're like, i don't know who any of these fucking people are
the one the the the girl though the
one that the one guy fantasizes about
having sex with lots of the hair she has
the big hair fingernails her fingernails
are so long like it's scarier than the
Claus and Santa Claus she was she was
Santa Claus yes but she's waiting for
her boyfriend to come who's the real
estate guy no no I think your boy was
mustache guy oh okay
but either way she was waiting for her
boyfriend to come and I guess she got
tired of waiting and just made out with
that other guy real estate yeah yeah
yeah
coke fiend gave her shit about cheating on mustache man with real estate guy before he decided to try and rape her
"Bob!"
oh, yeah
yeah
oh, yeah
which casued her to casually take a bath
no, she got in the hot tub
but, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right
oh
wait
oh, my god
what's happening
is he a vampire
is he a vampire
what's happening
oh
what
what
oh
what was that
what
okay
it was a mistaken identity
he tries to rape her, and then they cut away like to like something for like two seconds
and then he just a just sitting
on his lazy boy like this and she's just
it's like okay so we're not gonna dress
this and then everybody dies in the last
10 minutes
well should we just talk about the
deaths does it matter when you talk
about the desk like there's the hot tub
death hot tub death electrocution
probably the highlight is the the bear
trap what except in a bear trap you
bleed out of your coat
the only explanation is the force of the
bear trap squeeze the blood yeah up
through his body like a like a tuba
toothpastes
Oh gross this is very important to us a
lot I'm sure there's a tiny bear trap in
that it's filled with razors Oh
somebody's up that out for him yeah
poison Oh nope just stabbed in the
shoulder was exciting I knew I should
have eaten that pie they literally lured
him there with a delicious looks good
and is there is there a twist
no yeah exactly
yeah wewe speculated it was the blonde
haired lady which would have been good
don't yeah she's the center of the love
triangle she felt bad that the crazy guy
was like jealous and he was so jealous
he went angry drunk skiing and died as
the result of it and she's mad and then
you sure went crazy and then well we see
multiple scenes of her like lifting
weight yeah and the red herrings and so
I was like oh she's yeah a strength to
kill all these people then they have the
one girl cutting carrots with her knife
and she's like oh yeah the way she cuts
those carrots the cutting board is where
you put the stuff that's been cut oh
yeah it's more the cutting yeah why
would she make that choice to do that
yeah is she an idiot could she'd be that
stupid or did somebody think it just
looked better for her to use her hands
well as it turns out she's also the
editor for the film
how'd he die
the killer I forgot on the killer dog
well he doesn't real estate guy happened
to be there on the night when guy who
were all blue he was the brother I think
it was yes one guy one angry drunk
skiing and fell and hit a rock and died
yes his real estate guy went to try to
help him and fell down and injured
himself so badly he had to get his leg
amputated yes which caused him to not be
a world champion skier or world-class
businessman and that's that's a woman's
ball and that's the lady's fault that
woman's yeah random people had to die
this the real estate guy who's been
running a real estate business just fine
decided four years later not five four
not three by seven not 2 not 12
what four was the year that he was gonna
seek his revenge yeah yeah because his
peg leg or his fake leg he was mad yeah
that was the year and also that was
undoing at the end
she didn't do any cocaine
she's had, just, no ill intent juice
she was just there to have fun
yeah
what a fucking nightmare
and all these fucking guys are crazy with their fake legs, their cocaine, hallucinations
this poor women just want to have fun on a ski trip
ridiculous
when she ran outside without pants
she should have found mustache guy's
pants oh thank god those ketchup he
pants this is in 1952 McDonald's and
that's worth something
oh and also we got to cut five years
forward after that we're in the span of
five years she gave birth to eight year
old and yet so they building a snowman
and it Sue's me so there's something in
it it's a very large the Lord sue man
the way it's sloped so strangely large
snowman must as if a dude was gonna pop
out of it stab her in the face but that
wouldn't make any sense
no it sure wouldn't
they didn't even do it effectively
though like you think it like you
mention carry the hand and it's like
there's that musical sting or Friday the
13th
Jason jumps out there's a musical thing
but here it was like so he just kind of
a dude abou Shema names freeze-frame and
also it's bad quality and then they zoom
in on a frame so it just it's pixelated
to begin with that was their art don't
you put down also they have two children
and they bring them back to the same ski
resort murders and you want to explain
that away they went to a different ski
resort and I guess the killer just found
them there a desolated in a snowman I'm
assuming they built that snowman how did
he get in there maybe the Snowman was
built before they showed up they got there
how long was he fucking waiting in that thing
that's an awfully big snowman
yeah yeah that's vicious you know I'm
gonna go with this whole movie was just
a dream
oh I was leaving I was away on you yeah
everybody did one but J because J you
know a lot about garbage day sound like
deadly night parts 1 & 2 silent yeah
part 2 is basically part 1 recapping
recapping part 1 we spoiled it you're
doing my job that's all about Silent
Night deadly night part 2 well Silent
Night deadly night part 2 picks up after
the events of Silent Night deadly night
part 1 and if you haven't seen that film
don't worry don't worry about it we
timed it we looked at the counter the
first 40 minutes are a recap of Silent
Night deadly night part 1 it's almost
literally the first half of the movie
yes almost exactly the the killer in the
first movie is Billy
Ricky is his younger brother who was in
the first film but now he's the main
character we've had more actors playing
the same character than the Terminator
franchise yeah John Carter ain't got
nothing on Ricky
hmm Ricky who did it
Santa Claus there's there's baby Ricky
yes who remembers everything that
happens to his parents when he was a
faith
Ricky remembers everything that that
bill een does I don't know what made him
stop actually I do know what made him
stop yeah yeah that's the thing is the
first 40 minutes or flashbacks to Pat
out the movie and it's yeah it's it's
some of the dis flashbacks the things
that neither Ricky nor Billy were
present for yes but he's he's recalling
these events they're extrapolating some
of them well sure it could just be from
Ricky's point of views what we do see
later in the movie he goes to the movie
theater and watches the first film
that's a trip was about it's great it's
about this guy who dresses up like Santa
Claus and kills people
what maybe right oh the the the first
film was it wasn't reality it was the TV
movie of the week recreation so the
movie we're watching is a movie within
this man we never saw the real event yes
unreliable narrator kind of like thing
this looks like he's remembering it was
real for it but he did watch the movie
adaptation of his long ago okay yes
so he's unreliable yeah exactly so again
what he's telling the therapist is not
necessarily what's true it's kind of
what he it's whatever in the film or
what he's spinning or what he saw in the
film we've solved it alright we've
cracked the case that's pretty brilliant
great episode guys yeah so there are 15
Ricky's and and two of them are adults
there's two kid Ricky's because there's
an original kid Ricky from 71 yeah well
there's the baby and then there's
there's baby there's I'm calling a kid
sure the first kid when they're at the
home with the nuns yes and then there's
kid with the adopted parents yes oh yeah
yeah yeah the kid with the adoptive
parents that's terrified to the nuns yes
look what is it sweetheart
what is wrong
the movie there is the result of because
the original movie came out and it was
controversial and thanks to mothers in
Milwaukee it got pulled from theaters oh
yeah
vaguely very vaguely yeah really yeah
everyone was upset about the advertising
because he had the g-men pulled this MIM
mothers in Milwaukee that's the secret
of all the advertising for it was the
the Santa arm coming out of a chimney
with a yeah with a hatchet I've seen
that in the paper like yeah and so
mothers were like one this is terrifying
her children and two this is ruining the
sanctity of Christmas so there was lots
of protests on the movie got pulled from
theaters after like a week or two Oh
Mickey Rooney did it was very vocal
about this film and his for this movie
and then he ended up starring in Silent
Night deadly night 5 because he needed
cash negative publicity profit money but
so the idea was the studio was like okay
our movie got pulled immediately we want
to make some more money off this let's
rerelease it will re-edit it and
re-release it but let's add a framing
device to it
oh so the sequel is that so the sequel
the original idea was yeah a little bit
of the beginning a little bit at the end
and then the rest of the movie would be
a flashback is a recut version of the
first movie but then they shot a little
too much footage and so then yeah the
the second half of this movie is the new
footage that makes some sense
that's an interesting a bit of a history
Jay because I just assumed that this was
a cheapskate remake where they just said
well take footage from the first one
that crazy Ethel - yes oh yeah Hal
together something we don't the shoe
shades of grey' season 2 it's Jacob say
it's an example of them being overly
ambitious
if the idea was just to have you know a
an opener and an Ender and then the
first movie in between they shot so much
that half of this movie is a new movie
Jay thinks 50% of a movie is Oh
in the case of this movie yes I do
because once we get to the new stuff
it's it's it's magic what does this have
to do with anything
what's his name
it's Eric Freeman
Eric Freeman
fucking masterful
masterful
masterful
yeah
enthralling
he is so intense, and he is so committed
yes
he is 100% behind what he is doing which
is appropriate because he's playing
somebody who was committed but then we
so we get through the flashbacks to the
first movie and then we go into more new
flashbacks where he's a teenager he
comes across this this elderly couple
and there are actually 22 in the film
but you know Alison yeah and the elderly
man was was getting really abusive with
the woman which gives him flashbacks to
when he was a baby and he remembers his
mother when this guy is talking like a
shit-kicking cowboy
riki steals his Jeep which is red and
that oh yeah that's improved that see
that is triggering it's so important it
has an exclamation point at the end of
it this is a horror movie you expect for
heard of the free guy and we mowed down
herself but instead thank you it tied
into a bigger overall theme with the
film because look this guy this it's a
beautiful day they're having a lovely
picnic and then this guy just gets super
rapey any rips our shirt open he's again
yeah and then we tie into the plot of
the abusive nun
yeah Mother Superior who says you know
yeah I gotta beat you and and certainly
naughty naughty we don't really have a
clear villain because he's killing like
bad people and he says first it's a
Dexter yeah so we don't know at the end
it's it's him versus Mother Superior
comes to kill her at the nunnery
but yeah Mother Superior is played by
different actress so they make her face
her face cancer yeah and it's never
commented on well the movie at this
point once we get past the first movie
it is just kind of scene after scene of
Ricky encountering an asshole
yeah
and killing him
so we don't know who our villain is
he's not like a typical movie
villain where he's so crazy I'm yeah
well the first movie is yeah he just
kills people that he thinks are be not
even if they're not I guess Linnea
Quigley is just fooling around other
boyfriends one of my favorite parts you
were talking about it when we watched in
the movie was when he gets ahold of the
cops gun or
his rampage well that's a no that's the
centerpiece of the film so we start with
him exploding this guy with the ship
yeah
what did Chip do now he was kind of a
jerk he's a jerk
and this is, this is Ricky's motivation to blow his eyeballs out with
that's fine
that's fine 
with this car battery
it's just chip
Ricky is fucking psychotic
yeah, well, yeah
which is fine
yeah
"Punish!"
"Uh-oh!"
uh-oh
gulp
oh, no
Because that's when he loses it
at that point, he's no longer, like, the good guy who only kills bad people
he just starts murdering fucking everyone
kills chip he kills his girlfriend the
cop Bernie fight show is so much fun
come on Barney fight I've been drinking
that's why his hands crooked so they
could do the thing on his forehead and
you would see it
they'd never tilted up hey what's going
on oh my god he gets shut down
wasn't he taking out the trash it was
holding up a tree that's the next guy
that's the famous scene yeah make sure
we all cut that it's a really bad day
and Sherman Oaks it's garbage
it's that famous that's garbage it's
guys it's right here this was like like
a mean before means were a thing the
whole garbage day thing is if if anybody
knows this movie it's for garbage day
you know um but yeah the music swells
it's all of a sudden like really epic as
he's walking around this little suburban
neighborhood just laughs they kind of
turn it into a hero or like somebody
you're rooting for it's like falling
dull and you're rooting for Kirk Douglas
exactly yeah yeah Michael Douglas not
Kirk is still alive he'll be in the
remake falling down falling down to Kirk
Douglas by the way we have to point out
it's still a lot oh okay I was sad to
say that for so long
okay
drag the seats are filled with gasoline
yes that's the part that explodes up the
seats we have the most death-defying
stunts ever committed to film oh wow I
mean that looks like an accident like it
looks like it wasn't supposed to get
back it's a stunt I need an accident at
the same time yeah I mean the whole
movie is an accident but that particular
moment like the road warrior yeah oh
yeah yeah well the guy goes spinning
yeah he's very casual though like they
were able to use it the movie because he
just kind of like OOP
yep and no he didn't run away someone
else gets killed yes and not from
garbage day yeah he's right there oh
yeah and so no stunt gone wrong and that
John Landis film the Blues Brothers
where where the car what is so funny you
know there's a lot of stunts it's your
tongue so you say I just I just don't
see what's so funny looked pretty
dangerous Mike he thought you were
talking about that stunt from the Blues
Brothers 2000 oh I get the confucian
and this is we're still in flashback
this is how we learn how we got into the
prison that you're preventing since the
beginning of the film 90% of this movie
is flashbacks yeah it's only about half
of that or more than half of that yeah
there's flashbacks it escapes the prison
by choking the FBI or the psychologist
psychiatrist whatever it is and then he
leaves and we hear off-camera all right
the prisoner then what happens after
that
I just also I love like it's so cheap
because he's escaping the prison we've
got a problem sister he walked out of
here six hours ago it's Christmas Eve
well as we realized while watching the
movie it feels like they shot us like in
like five or six days which is where we
get the scenes similar to Santa Claus
where he gets the Santa Claus costume
compared that to Santa Claus where it's
like we watch them go in and buy the
things I love how this Santa Claus made
this look like cinema yeah take it from
no no we need to see him go to the
thrift shop look they didn't even have
to film the scene got off camera yeah
audio told it visually mmm you know they
figured out a way to do it creative yeah
we don't have to hire an actor we don't
have to find some a fight scene
silent I definitely was bad but it does
feel like we did the best we could with
the three days we had it's a little
cinema you're gonna get a Santa Claus
costume and you establish a Santa Claus
guy who works for the Red Cross but see
there's Elvis costume they don't even
tell but it works better than that yeah
yeah it's like like like Arnold and
Terminator 1 or 2 give me your clothes
your clothes you know he doesn't know
what thrift store you talk to that yeah
tell me where you've got your store and
I will buy those clothes bill paxton
tell me will you borrow $5 I need money
which thrift store did you get the
similar jacket and sunglasses like that
yes we don't have movie movie language
stealing murdering and still got it got
it one shot
so then we get what we've always wanted
to see Santa Claus versus a woman in a
wheelchair hundred year old woman she
did great she did member than anyone
else in the movie she needed to use the
power of Jesus with like electrical
bolts and like magic
now would've been great because she had
supernatural powers as a nun like and
he's like the garbage kid yeah like the
Christ Bolt she has powers as a none
other than just being crippled and
deform oh my god
wait how'd she get her wheelchair back
she has another one downstairs
why does she live upstairs I want her to
see her head like a button that's for
the secret wheelchair to pop was the
future she needs like a hover chance
lying around him crucifix missiles
it's got like a ruler that waves around
that's a reference of the John Landis to
remember that tragedy
so what's the best of the worst well as
the person in charge tonight's we watch
three extremely terrible films but we
must pick a best of the worst Jay oh no
contest in Silent Night deadly night
part two legitimately entertaining I
mean you do have to sit through half of
the original film but all the new stuff
is great we didn't even mention the
umbrella kill rich I'm going to echo Jay
sentiments
it is a master class performance of a
crazy man
it's interesting interesting I just need
to quickly quickly look at the name of
this one okay by far by far are you
kidding me like it's it's it's fantastic
Eric Freeman is fantastic in it you
don't have to see the first one but no
what's with that go ahead I know I think
I know my pick for best of the worst
this is Santa Claus antics have become
predictable no I'm not being a
contrarian she wants luxuries
yeah my reason is I've seen book Silent
Night deadly night part 1 but you hadn't
seen Silent Night WI but it was a most
of the movie was Silent Night deadly
night part 1 and guy talking to guy
interviewing him in Asylum room or a
hospital or a boring until it wasn't
that any more boring think I've never
seen a movie quite like that before no
you know you're right Mike I've never
seen him
be quite like that before I'm gonna
change my vote I'm going with Santa
Claus all right you know what I've never
seen a movie like ice before it was
bored out of my mind so that's my pick
for best of the water nicely the ending
of iced comfortably tickle mine my pink
- nice choice my think is ice because
I've never seen a movie like I just said
I really like breasts how do you know
what you like breasts you like this was
explained to you in the movie explained
to me in the movie it's education you
didn't know pornographers before you
learned so much you make a very good
point I changed my vote Santa Claus
right Santa Claus is the worst thing we
watch tonight is now in the water and
now the most entertaining one with the
great lead performance and many many
many fun easy and the and it's on
blu-ray - what a terrible format now the
cheapest movie we saw so I think we're
all in agreement we're gonna destroy the
worst Christmas ever
