Mike: Oh, I don’t have a watch. Goddammit, where is he, he’s always late [sighs]
[Door opens] M: Oh! Fuck, Rich, you’re finally here!	
Rich: What? 
M: We have to start shooting a new Best of the Worst!
R: Oh! Oh, hold on, let me—I just have to take my diabetes medicine first
M: There’s no time! [Snatches container, throws it on the ground, crushes it and kicks it] Fuck your diabetes medicine, come on! 
R: But I—I-I’m gonna—I might—I’m gonna die!

[00:53] [At the Plinketto board] R: Hi! And welcome to the least creative comment section on YouTube! Check it out! [Points downward, Mike looks at the ground]
M: Oh my god
R: That’s the same shit they’ve been saying for 5 years!
M: Is this comment section replacing the Plinketto board?
R: Is this Plinketto board replacing the comment section? Is Jay replacing Susan?	
M: Rich? Are—
R: Is Josh replacing the Plinketto board?	
M: Are you replacing Rich Evans?
R: Is Star Wars replacing Rich Evans?	
M: Rich Evans—
R: We—we—it’s not funny! [Background music stops] Stop! [Music starts up again] 
M: Rich? Are you—
R: Is Rich Evans replacing Mike Stoklasa?
[They switch places] M: Oh, oh! 
R: Oh my god, Rich Evans has replaced Mike Stoklasa!
M: The real question is, is Mike Stoklasa replacing your diabetes medicine? 
[Flashback to Mike crushing the medicine, Rich makes a sad expression and slumps his shoulders]
R: So, Mike, welcome to the all-new, all-different Plinketto board
M: So this Plinketto board is replacing the old one?
R: No, it’s the same Plinketto board, but I put a strip on here....
M: Oh! Oh
R: And now we have a ball
M: So there is a lot of replacing going on
R: Everything’s been replaced
M: [Laughs] I wish they’d replace you!
R: [Slumps his shoulders again]
M: Now, let’s talk about what’s on the board today. Our first film is called Abraxas, starring Jesse Ventura. Is it Jesse “the body” Ventura? Wasn’t that his name?
R: It’s “the mind” now, because his body’s frail and broken
M: The mind? The conspiratorial mind?
R: The conspiratorial mind—he did that when he ran for governor, he said “I’m Jesse ‘the mind’ Ventura now”
M: Now he’s Jesse “the crackpot” Ventura?
R: He’s Jesse “the arthritis” Ventura
M: Oh...What’s next?
R: Asylum of Terror!
M: Wow. Next, The Skateboard Kid, rated PG
R: Then Death Kick
M: Uh, Repo Jake, which looks like it stars Dan Haggerty, who was in Elves, remember?
R: How could I ever forget Elves? Then we have Mutant Species
M: And Big and Hairy
R: Deathstalkers 2
M: Dark Future, “we come to the 21st century.” Wow, well, that’s right now
R: And Back from Hell. All right, pull a Lance Armstrong and drop that ball!
M: [Drops ball] Here we go, here we go, oh my god, oh my god, what’s gonna happen? [Lands on choice] Oh!
R: Oh, it’s choice!
M: I can’t handle this pressure! Well, I—I’m leaning towards Death Kick or Mutant Species. I’m gonna go with Mutant Species
R: Mutant Species it is! We all lose!
M: Well, Rich, I picked Mutant Species—
R: Fuck off and read the box!
M: I am! Um, and I discovered a little interesting fact, it is a David Prior film
R: Aii!
M: I picked it because it stars Denise Crosby—
R: Oh-ho-ho!
M: A.k.a Lieutenant Tasha Yar, who—uh, Denise Crosby made the very wise decision to leave Star Trek The Next Generation and a lifetime of royalties to star in such films as Mutant Species
R: She could be, she could be making like William Frank’s money, Jonathan Frank’s money, William Frakes, William Riker, Jonathan Frakes, I fucked that up too, I fuck everything up
M: You really need to take your diabetes medicine. Also, the film stars Wilford Brimley. Speaking of diabetes [Snickers]
WB: I’m Wilford Brimley and I’d like to talk to you for a few minutes about diabeetus—[Zooms in] diabeetus—[Slowed down] diabeetus...
M: Uhh, “in the year 2003 the military has created a DNA formula for the ultimate killing machine, one that combines the predatory traits of animals, with those of man”
R: So it’s just like, a weaker animal [Pause]
M: [Keeps reading] Uh, “but when a decorated soldier is accidentally exposed, he begins to metamorphose into something more terrifying than anything ever imagined. A creature of pure instinct.” Well, I think it’s—he’s mixed with a dog [Points to picture on box]—that really looks like a dog
R: So it gets really excited when you come home?
M: I don’t know...
R: Tries to hump your couch?
M: He might just want to sniff your ass [Dog barks] Approximate running time....[Incredulously] 192 minutes
R: That’s gotta be bullshit. You’re lying [Reaches for the tape] You’re fucking lying. You’re fucking lying, Mike, I need to know! [They play tug of war with the tape]
M: 192 minutes, just trust me—
R: Oh god! [Puts hand on forehead] 
M: I would never ever lie to you. Alright, alright, lovely gentleman, let’s go
R: What?
WB: Diabeetus—

[5:56] [In viewing room] [Clown blows a party horn]
Jay: Oh no, it’s Eloise Cole! [Jack laughs] That kid’s just staring at the camera
R: That’s Denise Crosby, that’s her only scene in the film

[6:18] R: It’s actually like a board behind him, that he’s leaning against

[6:41] [Back at the board]
Jack: Now to pick our second movie, Rich Evaaans! 
R: [Gasps] Oh boy! [Drops ball] What is—
JK: The Skateboard Kid!!!
R: Ok, ok. The Skateboard Kid
JK: Looks pretty great to me
R: Oh my god, here: “no one could be more bored than Zack.” Or the audience…
JK: Snap!
R: That was—easy joke. “New kid in town and no friends in sight when a gang of hip, skateboarding thrashers start cruising his neighborhood. Zack hopes his luck will change, but they want nothing to do with him. Then Zack makes the discovery of his life: a talking, wisecracking, magical skateboard!”
JK: I’m sorry, a talking what?
R: A—a—a talking magical—wisecracking magical skateboard
[Pause] JK: The skateboard talks? 
R: Yes. And wisecracks. So it’s got an attitude
JK: Oh.....is that it?
R: What do you want? What do you—?
J: [Off-screen] We couldn’t help but notice that you did not say who does the voice of the skateboard
R: Oh my god!! Dom DeLuise as the voice of “Rip”
JK: Every kid’s favorite comedic actor, Dom DeLuise
R: What a bizarre choice

[8:16] [Guy punches skateboard into two pieces]
Jay and Jack: Oh no!!
M: Oh my god, that’s a strong man
JK: He just punched…
J: He punched the skateboard in half

[8:48] J: Oh my god….
R: This is embarrassing

[At the Plinketto board] 
JK: Alright Jay, third pick, and I have actually never gotten to drop on the Plinketto board before so I am really, really looking—[Jay takes the ball]…for—forward to you dropping it and seeing what movie we’re gonna play next
J: All right, I’m really rooting for Abraxas
JK: Ooh!
J: Let’s see what we get [Drops ball] Damn you!
JK: Repoooo Jake! 
J: Repo Jake. The prequel to Repo Man…? 
JK: Jay, that looked like a lot of fun. Did you have fun going up the ladder and dropping the thing down?
J: I guess?
JK: Looked like a lot of fun. Like I think it’d be neat to do. I guess, you know, whatever
J: Not sure what you’re getting at. I picked Repo Jake [Looks at tape] Is anyone else in this? Nope. Nope. Oh, this looks exciting, we got helicopters, we’ve got explosions, we’ve got Dan Haggerty putting a shotgun up to some guy’s nose. And a dirt bike. “Jake Baxter (Dan Haggerty) takes a job as a repo man who hopes of living the quiet life.” That’s not the job you take when you want a quiet life. That’s a job where you have to steal people’s shit. They get angry about that kind of thing. “Plans got sour when he’s whipped into supersonic action involving a vicious crime lord, a mob of angry car owners, a sadistic porno ring, and lastly, a brutal illegal and very lethal car race known throughout LA’s underworld as ‘The Slam Track’
JK: So there’s gonna be car races, there’s gonna be boobs and there’s gonna be angry old ladies wanting their car back
J: And Dan Haggerty looking like he’d rather be anywhere else, I’m sure.
JK: Perfect

[10:56] [Jake/Dan Haggerty won’t stop talking]
R: Shut up!
M: He’s so bad!

[11:15] R: Oh my god. This is the worst fight scene of all time.....This is awful!

[11:33] JK: Oh, ew, it’s in your mouth!
J: Yeah, she didn’t even kiss his lips, she kissed his moustache
JK: It tastes like soup!

[11:50] [At the table]
M: There were two girls, three girls that fell out of a ferris wheel and it didn’t turn properly and they fell out. It tipped them out. And then one little boy, like 3, flew out of a roller coaster but he’s ok. He landed on the ground and just—
R: He just landed on the ground, well that’s—
M: It was still pretty fucking scary though, if you’re sitting next to a three-year old and he flies out of a rollercoaster
R: Scary would be if he never landed. He just kept going
JK: Like in those cartoons where it’s like they end in a shimmer, in the sky
R: And the officials are all just like, I don’t know
J: He just kept falling
M: It seems like we want to talk about anything but these films. Uh, ‘cause they were the worst thing ever. This was a miserable, miserable day of watching films
R: Ah, you’re nuts

[14:21] M: That’s in styrofoam?
JK: They got to go to a museum
M: They filmed in a museum
JK: That’s really nice
M: History of NASA

[14:37] M: I like how everything’s close up just to hide the fact that they have no sense of location (???)
J: Ehh they shot somewhere [Mike laughs]
JK: They shot in a museum
M: I don’t even think that was a real space shuttle, I think it was just a model of one

[18:52] M: Whenever I think of YouTube copyright robots, I always picture the things from The Matrix, the squid things

[20:20]J: And—and you pointed out, we were like, the monster in this movie is the worst monster design ever, and we were like, how is this worse than a Don Dohler movie?
M: Yeah, I think it’s because we could see the Don Dohler monster
[?????????? appears on screen over a clip from the movie where you can’t tell what is happening]
J: Technically, it’s better
JK: And the claw hands
J: That’s the thing; he’s got these big floppy arms. It’s Pumpkinhead meets Rawhead Rex. And it sucks
M: Speaking of asexual, let’s talk about Denise Crosby

[21:04] [At table] J: What do you have, Mike?
M: Why, look at this [Lifts an action figure still in its packaging] It’s Denise Crosby in a Star Trek action figure
R: It’s mint in box
JK: Don’t open it, it’s mint in the—[Mike opens it] 
R: It’s worth nothing
M: Watch me open it
R: This...
J: We barely could’ve gotten 2 bucks for that before you opened it
R: This used to be worth 20 bucks on clearance
J: What has she done other than Pet Sematary? That’s—That anyone knows?
R: She’s the Pete Best of Star Trek
M: [In a girly tone] Mhmm-mmh-hmm-mhm!! [Jay and Rich crack up]
JK: That was a fun noise
M: It’s a good analogy, I guess, yeah

[21:47] [In the movie, a boy shows up and staggers around]
M: What the fuck?
J: Who’s this dork?
M: A boy in a giant shirt?
JK: Is that a blind kid? [Silence]
M: I think he’s blind
J: Is that what that was supposed to be? ‘Cause blind people walk around like this? [Waves arms around in front of him]
M: [Gasps] His name’s Geordi and he’s blind!
[At table] R: Can we talk about Geordi?
J: Oh yeah, if we’re talking about—
M: Her kid brother in the film is named Geordi—
J: And he pretends to be blind
R: Which must’ve really just, really, just rubbed salt in Denise Crosby’s wounds

[22:27] M: Yay it’s Wilford Brimley. Is he dead yet?
J: No!
[Zooming in on their faces] R: No?   J: No    JK: What?
R: Are you shitting me? 
JK: He’s had diabeetus at least for 20 years now
J: [Takes out phone] I’ll double-check--let me check, I want to say I looked him up the other day for some reason. Yeah, he’s still alive
R: I don’t believe that. I refuse to believe that
M: Wilford Brimley’s still alive, that’s amazing!
J: Yeah, good for him
JK: Luckily, Wilford Brimley has access to low-cost diabetes medication that gets delivered right to his door
M: Wilford Brimley still being alive makes diabetes look like the common cold. What’s the fucking problem?

[23:18] R: They’re gonna fly him to the headquarters where the whole movie he’s gonna be talking over a radio *Wilford Brimley’s next scene* [Does just that] [Everyone laughs]

[23:40] M: The real question is, did Dan Haggerty die of diabetes?
R: He died of alcohol
M: Of alcohol?
R: Just alcohol
J: Like someone threw a bottle at him and it knocked him unconscious and then he died?
R: Yeah
J: Ok
R: And then pure alcohol came out of his veins because he just drinks

[25:10] J: This asymmetrical lumpy nightmare is just saluting him

[28:06] M: Many things contribute to the skateboard becoming Dom DeLuise
J: This is what’s called a perfect storm
M: Oh yeah, yeah!
J: It’s all these elements together, if—if they hadn’t had been—like, if he didn’t put the motor on it, but it was still a magician’s skateboard and it got struck by lightning, it wouldn’t have come to life and been voiced by Dom DeLuise
R: No, it needed all of the things—
J: It needed all these elements put together
JK: I think it would’ve come to life, but it wouldn’t have had a mouth to speak with
J: Do you think if one of those elements was missing,  maybe it wouldn’t have had like, crazy eyes?
R: Ha! Maybe it needed like some kind of an additional element
J: One more thing and it would’ve been normal
JK: And so like imagine he just had the skateboard that got struck by lightning and now the skateboard has a conscience—
R: Oh god this is almost a horror story. If he didn’t give it a face or the engine—
JK: I have no mouth but I must scream

[29:36] JK: Dom Delabetes?

[29:46] R: That’s where you, that’s where you need the insulin and Burt Reynolds, to get by on that 

[30:10] R: My theory is that like, a group of skate kids who used to like, use their VHS camera to record themselves doing sick stunts— [Mike looks at the camera] —had a scheme to film themselves doing sick stunts with like a professional film camera—
M: Wait, wait, wait
R: What?
M: Not seven stunts?
R: It’s sick, Mike, sick
M: Sometimes I can’t understand you
JK: Sick is—
M: A diabetic slur
JK: Mike, sick is a slang word that like the film was made in the 90s—he was making a reference to—
M; Oh! Oh, I thought you were trying to be up-to-date with your slang
R: Sick
JK: Like these kids—
R: They were doing radical skateboard tricks
M: Ok
J: Wait wait wait wait, are you saying this movie was made in the 90s?

[31:01] [Kid does skateboard tricks]
All: [In a “radical” voice] Wooaaah! Wooow!

[31:21] J: How could you tell?
R: Well, it could be a period piece, I suppose. It’s an elaborate period piece

[32:39] J: The main skateboarder has—a—jorts, that are so amazing that Kevin Smith is jealous of them
M: The way Kevin Smith dresses he looks like Dorf [Jack and Jay laugh normally, Rich cackles]

[33:00] JK: For those who don’t know, uh, we—if anyone is younger, jorts, also known as shpants—
M: Jean shorts
J: Jean shorts, they’re just really long shorts
M: Jorts means jean shorts, everybody, in case you’re not aware
JK: But jorts as we are referring to them, or like I said, shpants—
R: What are you people talking about?
M: Rich, don’t you know anything about fashion?
R: No, I put on a pair of shorts and pants, pants and shirt when I go out, what—what—what is it, jort? 
JK: We’re talking about the folly that was 90s fashion
J: Yeah, yeah
R: But—what—how does this relate to like, a parachute pant, like I’ve heard of
JK: Ok, ok, so imagine—
M: MC Hammer pants
R: Does that go with a croc? [Jay and Jack laugh] 
M: Crocs are shoes!

[33:55] [Talking about the Brett Favre texting scandal] M: He sent a picture of his, of his uh, private parts to a—
R: Of his pig skin?
M: Of his pig skin to a, uh, of his, of his, of his leather helmet—
J: Oh!
M: Ha! Ah ha! To a female news reporter while wearing crocs. And Rich, crocs are more of a early 2000 thing as opposed to a 1980s thing which was a MC Hammer parachute pants—and parachutes were not used in Mutant Species—
JK: Yes they were, yes they were
J: They were used as stock footage
[Soldiers in movie land] M: Well, they tried
R: They don’t even have the parachutes on, when they land

[34:44] M: Skateboard kid, aka Zack, aka Taylor, aka—
R: Zachary Taylor 
J: Zachary Taylor Thomas
JK: Ohh
R: It’s another 90s reference!
J: An imaginary 90s kid that doesn’t exist
JK: Zachary Taylor Thomas?
J: Zachery Ty Bryan and Jonathan Taylor Thomas are the 2 Home Improvement kids
R: Wait, wait, wait—
J: That you combined into 1 on a previous episode
R: I thought they were, I thought it was Zachary Taylor Thomas!
J: There’s not a human being—
M: Zachary Taylor was a US president, which it further complicates things and although he was a president—
R: Oh my god, now congress is getting involved
M: Although he was a president in the 1800s, he was also on Home Improvement
J: Oh! Sure
R: This is getting nuts

[37:22] [Rich yells Woooaahh!! for ten seconds straight]

[38:38] M: Is this where they got the idea for Swiss Army Man?

[39:17] JK: Rip, you are dead!
R: You already did the magical flying scene! Why are we doing it twice? It’s less magical, it’s routine. You’ve played your hand!
JK: Yeah, but they have all this aerial footage, Rich

[40:03] M: Well, it would’ve been awkward and—and—and if the kid grew up with the skateboard still being alive and he’s gotta—I gotta go to college now...get in the shed
JK: I have to go masturbate, can you go into a different room—[all laugh]—I have to have sex with this girl who’s now technically my sister, so that might be weird for you—how is that—
J: Oh yeah, that’s weird 
M: It would be kind of, kind of, like, like, like the Brady bunch, just with—with more fucking
R: No one fucked Dom DeLuise [Mike and Jay laugh]
M: I’m sure somebody did! 
JK: He has a kid, Dom DeLuise Jr
J: Oh yeah!
R: Like, like, like on accident? Like, somebody trying to get past him on the bus? [Mike covers his face, Jack and Jay are having their own conversation] Their dick got caught in one of Dom DeLuise’s folds? They couldn’t get it out?
M: Wait! Why is it a—a chick? Wait, do—you guys missed this
J: I missed all this
M: Ri—I said nobody ever—Rich said nobody ever fucked Dom DeLuise and I said sure somebody must have and he said on accident, on a bus somebody trying to get past him and their dick accidentally went in one of Dom DeLuise’s folds
R: Got caught—folds—in his folds
M: I’m picturing a lady, like, trying to, trying to, like climb over him and accidentally, you know...
J: Sure
M: And—and Rich was thinking a man
J: [Just going along with it] Ok
R: Would that be the far easier way to have an accidental fuck?
M: Like, like he’s sitting on a subway and a man’s walking in front of him and they—he has—his pants break open—[all laugh]—and his penis comes out and goes in Dom DeLuise’s mouth?
JK: Like fat folds?
M: Fat fold? Ok, ok
R: Just—somebody—just has to be somebody walking past Dom DeLuise in a crowded space, they don’t know their fly is down. And it all just kind of happens
M: But—but a male with an erection—
JK: But once it’s in there, you know—
R: It’s on the bus, maybe they were reading porn beforehand
M: Wouldn’t it just be poke me in the bandit? Poke me in the bandit? [Jay laughs] I just want to know why when you’re thinking someone accidentally has sex with Dom DeLuise on a subway, it’s a man. And not a lady
JK: ‘Cause it’s easier, I get it
R: It’d be easier!
M: Dom DeLuise has a newspaper out and his—his—his penis is out and there’s a lady—
JK: Why is Dom DeLuise’s penis out?
M: Because he’s a sex pervert—[Everyone bursts into laughter]—and—listen, listen! It makes perfect sense. Dom DeLuise has a newspaper and he’s masturbating on the subway and a lady comes by wearing a skirt with no underpants. And she’s gotta get over him to get to the next seat [Rich cackles] This is completely plausible! Under certain circumstances it’s totally plausible. And then the subway makes like a jerk and she falls—[Rich covers his face]—and everybody hears the ppbblllll!! [Rich dies of laughter] And then there--that’s how Dom DeLuise Jr came about
JK: I think it’d be far more plausible that a different man accidentally had sex with a sweaty, vaginal fat fold
M: Maybe in like the--the locker room, you know, after the racquetball
JK: Right
J: Dom DeLuise doesn’t play racquetball [Pause]
JK: No, he’s just—[Rich suddenly laughs louder than before, Mike uncomfortably glances at the camera] He’s just waiting for the nice-looking men to come back
J: Oh, he wants it? He wants men to fuck his fat folds, is that what you’re saying?
M: Do you think Dom DeLuise gets pregnant in his fat folds? And they—they pull the baby out like, like, they pull the little slug—
R: Now, now you gotta come up with a whole convoluted scenario for like, a, for like an egg to get embedded in one of his folds first
M: No! It’s like The Wrath of Khan when the pull the slug out of the back of the thing—and it comes out of Dom DeLuise’s fat folds
R: But you need, you need an egg to impregnate that gets in there
M: Not with Dom DeLuise           J: Pfff!
R: So was he like, was he like, rooting around in the trash for food after his career has tanked and he like, he accidentally got like somebody’s used tampon stuck in one of his fat folds?
JK: Oh...[Mike covers his mouth]
R: That’s the only way that can come about!
M: No! He thought that he—
R: And somebody has to accidentally fuck him in the same fat fold!
M: He thought a used tampon was a deodorant stick. And he was going like this, when two guys with erections fucked his armpits
R: Accidentally?
M: Accidentally, at the same time
JK: ‘Cause remember, he’s hanging out in the locker room, he’s just waiting for it...
M: Because they—he’s so fat, they thought this armpits from the back were two butt cracks
JK: Wait, so now gay men are accidentally having sex with Dom De—
M: Not accidentally, intentionally [Silence, Jack makes a blank expression]
R: Then it’s not an accidental fuck anymore!
J: Well, what’s accidental, is because they don’t realise that it’s fat folds. They think it’s an orifice
M: They think it’s two giant butt cracks next to each other
R: Well that’s not accidental, that’s just fraudulent!
M: Well, it doesn’t matter. Tell that to the family court. When we talk about custody
R: For Dom DeLuise’s armpit child?
JK: Children
M: He carries them for nine months in his armpits
J: He didn’t realise it, though. It’s like the really obese woman that doesn’t know she’s pregnant until the baby drops out
M: This one day on the subway again—
R: For the first time he decides he’s gonna do a jumping jack [Everyone bursts into laughter]
J: And like 10 children fall out
M: Oh my god, it’s twins?!

[46:08] M: Coincidence? Probably.

[47:07] M: Mask
J: Why do we call him Mask?
M: Mask is a movie about a guy who has elephantitis of the face and he’s an ugly man but he’s—
J: And you’re comparing that Mask character to the actor in Repo Jake?
M: He kinda looked like him

[47:26] R: I was gonna say you skipped over a bunch of stuff, but then I just realized, almost nothing happens in the movie

[47:35] JK: So there’s a big race and the winner of the big, demolition figure-8 race gets $75,000 and—[Rich pretends to fall asleep and snores]

[48:44] JK: She’s just like, it’s just my purse, it’s not worth it
J: Destroy that man’s business. Oh, he broke that window twice. He already broke through that window

[50:24] M: Oh my god, it’s Dave Grohl 

[51:02] J: Oh! We should point out that the entire movie takes place on one cul-de-sac. Which I’m guessing—my theory is that PM [Looks closer at the tape]—that’s that home video company, but that’s where their production offices were and so we see the same building across the street every time he repossesses a car [Mike takes out his phone] What is Mike doing? [He doesn’t look up] What are you doing? [Shows the phone’s screen] Oh my god?!
M: At the time  this movie was produced, they printed their address on the back of the box, but—
J: And you just looked it up on Google maps—
M: In the future, where we are now, I looked it up on Google maps, and it is that location that we see in the film 5 times in the film
J: Technology is an amazing thing
M: It’s a good guess to say that was literally the parking lot of their production office. It’s proved by Google maps
R: What kind of shoddy filmmakers would do that?
M: I don’t know
JK: Shoot half of the movie right outside their studio?
J: Yeah
M: That’s right [Looks at camera] That’s just lazy and cheap [Various clips of Space Cop are shown]

[53:06] R (?): “I don’t normally date woolly mammoths”
[54:06] M: We needed to know that Dan Haggerty had to eat

[54:45] King/Robert Axelrod/Tim and Eric guy: Now I see two people doing a little kissy-kissy and I see a buncha girls walking around in bikinis, what is this, a beach movie?
Director: It’s in my script—
King: Fuck the script! These girls can’t read! People like to see black guys fucking white blonde women. There’s your plot. They all just took a love drug. They all got their clothes off and they’re fucking and they’re sucking the shit out of each other, and that’s the movie you’re gonna make—[Slaps the director]—you got it?
R: That’s the most real thing I’ve ever seen
M: That’s the best line of dialogue in any movie I’ve ever heard

[55:20] M: This movie’s gone off the rails, officially, and not in a good way. In a nonsensical way

[55:52] M: This is our eternal quest, to find that diamond in the rough, and it’s very rare that we do. So, we do the heavy lifting, for those of you out there that can’t suffer through this, this nightmare we call our lives.
