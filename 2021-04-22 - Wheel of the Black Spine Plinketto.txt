and i mean this thing it was it was literally a pile of junk
like it actually split down the middle
i actually spent a good month getting this thing back together
like you can't see it
there's just tons of just like screws and metal plates like holding this thing together in the back
i got the old sign and the original
wheel like the very first wheel we spun
none of the replacements that's it
i spent a ton of time rebalancing it it
works now
it's great well that's great rich i'm
sorry to tell you though

audience i mean

the
the video is taped live
while someone's having a safe sex cyber
sex encounter on the internet
i think it must have been hard for him
to take the video one-handed
what's your next tip like
why it's our old friends the silver
foxes this time with richard simmons
oh my god i mean richard simmons it's
that's
it's instantly got to be a jump in
quality right
what they desperately needed the last
time we watched the silver foxes was
someone to instruct them don't worry if
you're not following the exercises
perfect
just keep moving and have fun
uh well that's it
that's our last film that um we're ready
this we're ready to spin

meticulously rebuilding the wheel of the
worst
why don't you give it a spin all right
here we go
oh my gosh how to have cyber sex
on the internet oh god okay we can do it
you ready to go watch this instructional
tape
nope well
i guess we won't be needing this anymore
fuck my life
computer prices have dramatically come
down while performance continually rises
for less than fifteen hundred dollars
you can grab quite a package
i see what they're doing performance
outperform rambo this is something i
normally do in private but for
instructional purposes
i'm going to let you watch me have
computer sex live on the net
we'll also visit others who have
mastered the art of one-handed typing
and now it's time for the most popular
segment on best of the worst
the one everybody loves to do and the
one everybody loves to watch
it's black spine
i was hoping for his like couple some
applause or
oh no like it was cheers or something
for me
to put that put that in post just yeah
i'll have to fake that
get some sound effects because it's just
dead silent
well you know the game josh actually i

appear to be canadian right
hmm okay four line conics eh
god only knows what this could be let's
go find out all right
lack of any audio is is unnerving me
is it like an art installation thing no
i think josh is right like this is
settle down class it's about to start i
think this is something they show in a
classroom to explain mathematical
phenomena
your teacher is reading this blah blah
yeah
we're going by the assumption this is
about math
yes i mean here is a range of conics
a varying conic touching four fixed
lines
iconic is the circularly thing we going
rich shut up i know how this works
95 000 basic computer literacy

yeah what what why for money what
you're not supposed to get it wet honey
cash but
how much cash a lot of money she's doing
it for non-functional tokens
no more books no more books
no more books no more books
happy 100 uh happy
i mean can't be the word you want to use
100th episode
it's an achievement yeah i could
certainly say that
it's a perseverance yeah this is a
this is a monument to fortitude this was
like like getting to the top of mount
everest and
finding another smaller mountain i don't
know i don't quite know how to say it
like it doesn't feel like we have
achieved anything it feels like we've
made a setback it feels like getting to
the top of mount everest i'm wondering
why the [ __ ] you did that
yourself because we watched uh a bunch
of
stuff i'll just say stuff yeah yeah that
was a pile of stuff this this was an
amuse-bouge
of uh of of the best of the most
smorgasbord would be the better word
tiny tastings of all of those this was
this was a this was a this was a
groaning smorgasbord yeah
yeah we start we i mean we had the wheel
out there we had
the plinketto board which randomizes
feature films and we had the least
favorite thing
of anybody a black spine this was my
first experience with it today and uh i
hate it
yeah i hate it you know what i'm gonna
say black's bryant
black spine has grown on me okay for one
reason
like a fungus like a fungus yes okay but
if we don't like something we can just
turn it the [ __ ] off
there is that there is that sure yeah it
is the most lenient of the formats
i wouldn't have watched nearly as much
of how to have cyber sex
on the internet if it were a black spot
right right
all right right here we started watching
it and we just said [ __ ] this
that's what girls do that's how cyber
sex works i
you're always talking to two sexy
topless ladies yes
always that's definitely is on the other
end of that
this is something i normally do in
private but for instructional purposes
i'm going to let you watch me have
computer sex live
on the net now
i don't believe you are you bringing the
ducks tell me more about the ducks
she's by the lake in the beginning with
the ducks wants to let you know that
we're going to watch some cyber sex
today
yeah ducks and lakes and and foliage and
trees make me think of cyber sex
so the but the point when you when you
live on walden's pond what do you
what do you what do you think you're
doing when you go under your log cabin
and there's nothing else to do
that's true oh do you think
my beard is full of birds how do you
look
jack would you like to tell us how to
have cyber sex on the internet
son of a [ __ ] richard you did it
nice job my friend proud of you
happy 100 everyone i'm 105
pounds
petite peta
my name is peace i'm trying to say i'm
pete
oh take off my sweater my giant sweater
i'm gonna let them know why are you
leaning back like that that's so weird
so you can see her when she takes her
giant sweater off
um it takes some time with this sweater
well no it's just terrible
i said wait for my clothes you [ __ ]
don't do it lady so the premise of
this tape is an it's an instructional
video
on the logistics of having cyber sex
in like an aol type chat room you know
damn well that's
that's right no no that's the selling
point sorry that's the selling point
what this actually is is shirtless
women engaging in fictional
cyber sex towards actual people
in what can best be described as
uncomfortable poses
okay now he's asking me if i ate him
the tape well the tape is a scam right
yes number one we'll get into that but
easy-peasy early days of the internet
aol uh
compuserve uh what are some of the other
services that provided
audio galaxies yeah
so i think the gimmick was because it
says uh something about
safe sex encounters i don't know it says
safe sex encounters
taped live right there's nothing safer
yeah so whoever produced this video some
kind of
creepy pervert got some ladies to come
in
into his grandma's living room and and
to take your shirts off and
and like type perverted things into an
anonymous user
and on the screen you can see that it's
probably a real thing
that they recreated in a fictional thing
on the full
full screen size not very well
i seen any types then i would let you
take the tip of my
between this yeah they just randomly
decide when to have the text go like
this
and when to just have the whole word
appear there's no no consistency
she's lost the instructional part and
now we're just observing
yeah i guess lawyering on her
conversation
she's not disturbing that yeah she looks
bored
rich this is the definition of sexy
what's going on right now
listen no this is flat the lighting is
flat the shot is weird because it's not
even like centered
on on her in a weird like she's leaning
back
yeah we're still wearing her mom jeans
at first
we thought they were pretending right to
have cyber sex and this this is all
gonna end up being scripted the whole
the whole setup of the screen
is blatantly fake it's like dot-com
net.com yeah and the words the words
don't appear as they're typing they're
just kind of
randomly sort of show up at various
speeds
it was it was so amazingly awkward
what was going on that we started to
realize that
they might be talking to real people
i'd [ __ ] you slow and very very hard
until you begged me to stop
but i think he might have gotten a phone
call
he didn't like your story lady yeah
anymore i don't know if you're gonna
script out cyber sex you're not going to
say
the user logged off the user yeah
it was happening repeatedly
wait wait hold on i don't want to get it
on the keyboard
that's why they have keyboard covers
gotta go bye
done with you just the way things were
phrased you know and
and it's like if you scripted it you'd
be like okay well now this happens this
happens
you'd actually build in a sort of an arc
to it which the ladies are trying to do
but the men presumably or women on the
other side
are really a lot more interested in
orgasms and they want to kind of get to
that real quick
yes send
you jerky well there's one there's one
uh
character they were talking to that was
clearly a virginal
teenager who was like i i will do
you so hard and i want to touch your
boobs what do they feel like
what do your tits feel like like rocks
or silicone like a bag of sand
there's one yeah i was gonna say like
the way this guy's typing
we're talking to like a virginal
teenager
well there was there was the one lady
who really wanted to make sure that you
knew that she was a lady
oh yes said repeatedly at the beginning
20 years old
blonde m lady am definitely lady
female lady female type lady person
am lady girl i am lady
i am lazy i am lady hi baby
just for the record i'm lady lady
this is going off the rails
see that's
that would immediately make me think
that you were neither a lady nor a
female
i swear to god no penis hey lady
have lady bits
because they put the mic right by the
[ __ ] mechanical keyboard damn
we know that we noticed that the little
lavalier mic because there's no place to
put a lavalier
on the topless lady there really isn't
learned a little something today about
that
obviously production was not their
strong suit i think
as evidenced by the camera angle i don't
even think it was their weak suit it
just wasn't there
rich rich wait wait rich rich you when
when you're
when you're watching this right like say
say you
yourself rich were a pervert right and
you wanted to make a video like this
right
how would you how would you shoot it i
would want to see their
okay no we kind of could but it was from
like a weird
like yes how would you how would you
design this
the shots okay paint the picture for us
right now well the way
i i would probably move the camera as a
pervert
as a definite pervert i would move the
camera
so that it was over closer to behind the
computer
so you could see the subjects of the
video you can see their faces
you can see the face that's very
important in their reactions
yes jack i do think the faces are the
most important okay
in this situation can i ask you a
question yeah um
you know uh treat me as as one of these
one of these ladies with the boobs
um what sort of angle should i be
sitting at can i can i look at this
it depends where the camera is how far
down should i slouch
as a well-endowed female i think you
should i think you should
hunch over awkwardly yeah you like eat
like a punch like a hunch like smeagol
or or maybe like you know like
you know flawed what you or or should
you yeah no i think should you look like
you have pre-osteoporosis in your spine
and
and maybe like because there's nothing
sexier than knowing someone's going to
grow old
that was the most amazing thing i i
believe that these were either you know
strippers or porn actresses and they
were i believe
giving a hundred percent they were
trying to add
to the scene they were trying to make
video
and the people they were talking to were
just trying to get off exactly
that's not a hundred percent though what
i'm saying is they were building
the scene within our imagination this
was disgusting
this was absolutely i was disgusting
because i know one of those people was
you
and and i i just i'm tagging out
i'm backing out gonna get your ass in
here jay i'm tagging them
listen jay-z jay's here to finish this
all off on
cyber sex so i was told i was supposed
to come here to talk about how much of a
pervert rich evans is
oh yeah
i am cumin
do you think was it the director's job
to tell him to sit up straight i i mean
it's the director's job to get angles
that
make the women in the video look
attractive because that's also true
of the video that's true so he was
a failure
see my legs are open and you can see my
pink skin peeking through my brush
which bush senior or junior
jeb
see my pink skin peeking through my
clinton
well we're already starting from the
back of grandma's kitchen
the dining room table yeah but but is it
the point of the video and we talked
about a little bit during the um
during the just you know while we're
reviewing it but it really did seem like
specifically it is
geared because it seems extremely niche
it's not just like
oh i want to look at boobs you got a lot
of options for that you got a lot of
more options you know if you want to go
further than that this is a very
specific thing like these
are shirtless topless women all pants
stay on
all those mom jeans are just staying up
they're way up there and they're having
this chat
so our general theory on that was that
this is meant to be played in the
background while
men are in these chat rooms while they
do the cyber sex
while they do the cyber sex to give them
like a visual aid yeah this is who i'm
talking
if they if they're if their imaginations
themselves will not
take it far enough yeah that's why the
taped live
is the really important part it's really
key i think
oh you're killed i think he's a lesbian
oh
which one has a kilt
i i think you can still tape it live and
have it look good and have the girls
look sexy i think you can have the best
of both worlds if you put in
like a modicum of effort here jack
let's let's think about it this way you
have one money and no camera no wait the
other way around
no you were right yeah you want money
okay
what would you do what would you what
would you change in this situation you
have the girls
yeah they're there they're ready to take
their tops off yeah you have the
computer you have
10 hours of free aol uh okay lower the
camera
move it to the left tell the girls to
sit up straight god damn it
okay but tell them to tell the the women
to look like they're into it or
something
oh direction yeah yeah because as it is
it should just be called girls gone mild
rich
the chairs are just i guess the empty
left
now i'm going to type what would you
like to do to me
this is the most pathetic video that's
the most pathetic thing
is he typing anything back
but i think he might have gotten a phone
call
speaking of leaving oh oh no i get to
leave now oh oh
oh i gotta stay here yeah you gotta stay
here
okay you know why because it's time to
talk about black spine videos
now we're moving on to four line comics
yeah i i picked this one out and uh
man it's a trip i'm sure that
uh if it means something to somebody if
we could understand the math
involved behind this it would be
fascinating here is a range of conics
a varying conic touching four fixed
lines
iconic is the circley thing what
oh and the lines are the lines there are
four of them
but we don't understand the math not a
so what we did was we looked at the
pretty lines and then we turned it off
now in red is the line conjugate to the
first line
now in blue i got a d minus whatever
this is
it was fascinating because it's an older
film clearly like it's definitely like
50 60s i want to say yeah uh but the
weird fix though i don't think they
could have done that in the 50s it's
just animation let's just draw lines
if they can make betty boop dance they
can get the lines down okay they can
make four line comics
they're very straight lines oh they they
use they used a protractor probably
a protractor and a and a t-square
yeah sure why not you know always pole
and polar
are the same color
what i mean i know these are english
words
but in this order i don't know what they
mean it makes you want to put on the
tron legacy soundtrack
that oh sure yeah you want to go we
would show us an example here but our
channel would
get a copyright claim just imagine
just pretend yeah it makes you want to
listen to generic synth music
while watching oh we can play that
so that's that's that we're done what's
next what's next
uh basic computer literacy who pulled
this one this is me
what are the highlights this is some
magic right here this was something
different
whoa oh my god they wrote it backwards
oh
that took six weeks to render
take that pixar
mia ferro's had a hell of a year she's
gonna learn all about computers she
can't check her don't look at woody's
computer
this is the tale of a sad frumpy
housewife
who is terrified of computers she's not
that frumpy she's kind of she's kind of
she exemplifies
she acts like like her children just
died
which they may have
maybe if we sent the kids to the jungle
for camp this summer and sold your
mother to the foreign slave traders it
might help our attitude
well i know your son ferris is a real
problem
i was just trying to get your attention
it's a whole new area for me
there's so much to learn i'm intimidated
already
why is this so intense everyone's job
performance is going to be linked to how
well we use these machines
this was part of her acting reel for
decades
i saw an article about that very thing
today
you're wrong about women not
understanding computers
i told you i hated byron king
counted what the [ __ ]
boy this article is a different color
than the rest of the paper that's
bizarre
and the text is about mid-summer
she's so depressed that when her husband
starts going on about like her children
being kidnapped into slavery
yeah this doesn't rouse her out of her
deep dark depression
she's completely oblivious because these
terrible
terrible computers have come to take
over her job what could happen
so one night she has a terrible
nightmare
with with with thunderstorms and and
satan taking over her computer
oh no no not the micro machines guys
princess died oh no kathy gifford
after her co-workers laughed at her she
tore their faces off
you won't laugh at me anymore
get to the computer literacy part
i don't this is the winner guys this
wins this is bizarre
it'll be hard to beat this is uh what i
was expecting
no it's a giant gameboy
but then the friendly computer ghost
shows up to explain a bunch of things
that she couldn't possibly understand
the word computer comes from the latin
word meaning to reckon
consider or think some called read-only
memory
other chips provide random excess memory
a central processing unit the tapes and
disks peter hardware responds to
electrical switching controls zero and
one form the basis for the binary ascii
scientific decimal fractions
wow and this makes her feel better for
absolutely no good reason because she
still doesn't know how to use the
[ __ ] computer
i'm gonna tell you something after
watching this i think i forgot how to
use computers
yeah i know less about computers now
than i did before we watched this thing
that's interesting i had this vision of
people who work with computers as
well yes as some kind of antisocial nerd
nerd
the word tastes awful like when it says
like
the basics you think like okay you type
c colon slash directory to get the you
know
they didn't have that
how to use the word processor instead
it's more of a fantasy story it's like a
fantastical
mystery tale of of magic and wonder
and it doesn't have any any connection
to reality
indeed your modern computers would make
even the most accomplished wizard of my
day turn
green with envy
she is uncomfortable by this fact she's
just from another century not a fantasy
world right
most importantly
the computers or analytical engine as
they were called in my day
were made of gears like a clock
so this isn't going to teach us how to
use the computer isn't it no
this is just going to be about coming to
terms with the
existence of computers i think they're
going to get to like turning it on what
a mouse does
and like browsing the baby you're going
to lose your job but we want to make you
feel better about it
because yeah they can't get into what
you have to do with the computer at your
job
because it could be so many things we
can't go that far is that a type of acid
that oh now it makes no videos now the
computers are full of bunnies
frankenstein's there sure
like like hi welcome to basic com
what what basic computer basic computer
illiteracy i am
i'm you know whatever narrator man
some guy in a library in front of all
the computers first thing you do
turn on your monitor you want to make
sure your monitor is on power up your
computer
hit boot right right we're talking basic
theory
yes eve ordinary beach sand is mostly
silicon
highly purified silicon is used to make
semiconductors
knowing what the [ __ ] a transistor is is
not gonna do anything to save this
woman's job
she has a lesbian relationship with
the ghost of computers past they do it
all
they do fall in love they do it they
they they have very emotional it's like
like a victorian era uh lady whether
this is a dream or reality for your mind
is something you'll have to answer for
yourself
but why it is your choice really i can
be perhaps
to help you our frumpy housewife

[ __ ]
jack torrance was the bear
close the door close the door
we're talking about stanley kubrick
which is appropriate for this video
because there are very
few working assignments to it this
computer training video
does feel like the shining it is not how
many people have said that it is not
anything close to what we would have
expected from a video like this
this computer video does feel like the
shining
i'm gonna quote that right when they
re-release this on blu-ray that'll be on
the box
do you remember that scene in the
shining where they explained that ram
was made out of sand oh yeah
yeah yeah it was great but the twin
girls who were
dead yeah who were butchered by an axe
explain how a cpu works
wow when the when when the caretaker got
killed with an axe when he was trying to
explain what a disk drive does that's
what it was
so you just put the disc in the drive
random access memory random access
memory oh jesus
computers will play an ever increasing
role in your society
your children accept them just as
commonplace as you accept radio and
television you need to clean that mirror
too
yeah what is all that [ __ ] that's uh
that's the mirror at the sex
shop bad job usually usually there's uh
naked ladies behind there yeah like no
they just can't the lights aren't
audiences yeah it's the only place they
could afford to shoot
i just kept waiting for them to explain
how cyber sex works in this video but
they didn't get into it
that's volume two the two ladies were
about to they were well that wasn't
cyber sex that was
ghost sex there were that was true
god she's like if you didn't have
resting [ __ ] face
i would log on to an aol cyber sex chat
room with you
and we could chat with a 12 year old boy
it's okay because also inside your
computer is an exorcist oh thank you
i was just surprised that anyone was in
there at all
that's interesting uh uh i'm taking it
out
jack's coming back because he did the
monsoon monsters of rock and roll we're
only going to talk about it for five
seconds
he's out oh jesus i'll be back for the

well we did discover what skates is
86.97 oh oh
what's the g past year which you will
hear about this year
uh or today at first we we started
skates and i said
is it going to be a guy at a podium and
is it going to be jesus and
it turns out instantly guy had a guy at
the podium
in front of a cross it was a church
yeah and he started talking we're here
because of the providence of the lord
and let's go to him now and open this
session
father we are so thankful tell us what
scavenge mean
did we guess we guessed at the acronym
my guess was
south carolina association of
international hotel
service something yeah that was my guess
none of us could have guessed it was
about homeschooling as they have called
upon her and her expertise
in setting up organizations and dealing
with how to support homeschooling
families
right it was south carolina south
carolina yeah
that count you heard of something
something
it's the south carolina association of
independent home
schools mann was introducing the
president of skaves and then we shut it
off
according to the website of south
carolina's home school association
uh the scary's organization uh
is has no religious affiliation
oh we got your number right here we got
proof
we got approved we got the receipts but
as we opened today
let us remember that um we're here
because of the providence of the lord
you got cancelled
you just ruined our proof jack they were
jack in a destroyed our evidence
oh we have on
on dvd yeah we digitized it
you guys were having your meeting in a
church and you were talking about the
jesus
and you were talking about the jesus and
religious affiliation none
bye skates well good thing we recorded
it
to david day although we only recorded
the first five seconds
and then we stopped the tape all
together my goal in life
was to take down the south carolina
independent
historical society of homeschooling yes
or whatever it is
that was my one goal in life i'm sorry
mike yeah
i'm sorry i let my he used to tell me
that all the time back in high school i
know
you talked about it constantly how
irritated you were by those those
those lousy skates
in south carolina because the way that
they have recognized the
primary role you know what let's let's
pray away this case
[ __ ] so
our last tape the blankest
of tapes yeah nothing on it nothing on
it jay do you remember what we watched
uh this is how to prepare a funeral
how to prepare for a funeral starring
blanche devereaux from the golden girls
i never really thought about that she
was the horny one yeah
she made her husband stiff one last time
well it starts with a flashback of their
50th winning
wedding anniversary oh yeah party yeah
which i guess he died that same night
which is really unfortunate well no
there was a polaroid photograph that was
taken at the event
and blanche was holding it with flash
forward
maybe 20 five years 10 years were you
going to say
20 20 years you're being really generous
she looks roughly the same so we're
going to say like
we're going to say like six minutes
maybe the next day that night it was too
much for
for harold yeah the old ticker gave out
at the at the 50 50. he wanted to try
some cyber sex
and it just maybe she rolled out the the
cart full of cocaine and said you know
harold
hey why not you know we're retired [ __ ]
it
you only live once
if it's any consolation rest assured you
did
all the right things i felt so
inadequate i
really didn't know what to do there's
nothing more you could have done did you
hear that
you're going to do very well here this
morning that like
his ghost
he wanted the inheritance um
that's it it's how to prepare for a
funeral and ironically
uh the tape dies she must remember to
notify distant friends and relatives as
well as business associates
depending on religion she needs to
contact the clergy and coordinate their
involvement
a brief grave died there's a crease in
the [ __ ] tape
often followed by us oh guys the ghost
is trying to get out now
oh no my death will be avenged
mr mccracken's gonna start climbing out
of the white screen here
tape wants to get it over with and
slowly fast forwarding a bit
if wood is selected a sealed cement
protective wall is suggested to
flood's about to start tripping from the
corners
you push the wrong button you have
pushed the wrong button
oh it's starting to oh it's starting to
like wobble inside and out now i love it
yeah
yeah the whole images no one can be
expected to think of
all the things except for someone who
i'm stirring money in the bank i just
haven't had a chance
it's hanging in there for dear life
although the average funeral and burials
usually cost
less than many people expect they still
are a significant experience
there are many ways to play for a few
girls
oh
i hope the tape comes out it was the
most exciting thing that maybe has ever
happened
at any moment but like art live
art was going on for our eyes it's true
it's true and we risked the health of
our vcr
to tell this tale we watched the tape
die in front of our eyes
you know when you think about it this
whole show
is kind of a one giant wake for vhs
we all we all gather around this table
and we reminisce about the good times
and we're usually miserable while doing
it yeah like just like a wave like a wig
i mean the not so good times too yeah
like cyber sex on the internet
yeah for those ladies who are now
someone's
grandparents yeah mike art preservation
is not always pretty that's what we're
committed to here
preservation of art oh this is monsters
of rock and roll
we're committed to the preservation of
art
jack did you do something funny
or i can let you return to that hideous
place you just came from
please don't
who's who's actually doing this
i think this is just a group effort i'm
this is a i'm hoarse
right now i'm losing my voice because of
the last 10 minutes of this movie
and i i can't explain this thing without
completely losing my voice
here's the plot of the movie when neil
breen was a child
him and his best friend found a magic
mushroom
that turned into a jewelry box that gave
them
a obsidian cube and some rocks
the girl turned the rocks into a
bracelet
and he took the cube and held on to it
and then they never saw
each other again for both 40 years and
also 10 years
they aged differently they aged
differently is that you
it is isn't it so then ten and or
forty years later neil breen is on the
floor
and and ten ten and forty years later
neil breen is on the phone with his
russian wife when he gets hit
by a rolls-royce hi
yeah are you on your way home
okay so great he's not talking he
doesn't know where he is
i'm somewhere where i don't know where i
am
wait are you supposed to be talking yeah
you're supposed to be talking to her
who are all these people i wait where
are
what what what
can you hear me oh no
what's going on talk to me he didn't
he hasn't talked to you this whole time
no i got it by rolls royce
who are all these people where so neil
brain
gets killed by a stripper where he goes
to the hospital
and his doctor is his childhood best
friend who he hasn't seen in both 10 and
40 years
and then he goes home and he takes a
shower because he's fine after getting
hit by a car
except for the bleeding and he's both
covered with blood and not covered
with blood and then his russian wife
walks into the shower
and has awkward horrible disgusting sex
with him
and then neil breen also has a best
friend yeah
whose wife doesn't want to sleep with
him we don't have sex anymore
where did that come from where did that
come from
and then in the very next scene he does
not want to sleep with his wife
she wants to sleep with him even though
he has a ferrari you care
more about that car than me you would
rather be
drunk in here than with me and then they
have a party
yeah and the friend comes on to the
russian-speaking wife
get away from me jim you're drunk
and staying further away
jesus why can't we see their faces party
because that wasn't him oh okay that's
over yeah
i'm glad that was resolved cheers and
then his wife
shoots him because he still doesn't want
to have sex with her i'm going to shoot
this damn car off full of holes
no no no and then being a wise
the wife instantly frames it so that as
the friend committed suicidally
he killed himself
just in time for neil brain to come in
and have a dramatic scene with the
friend
i can't believe you committed suicide i
cannot believe you committed suicide
how could you have done this how could
you have committed suicide
oh [ __ ] i powered down for a second
there how could you have done this how
could you have committed suicide
i can't help you out of this one jim
suicide
oh anyway did that
he's reading his own book how could jim
have killed himself
and then neil breen is also we got oh
god i forgot he's talking
he's talking to a psychiatrist and
getting drugs that he is not taking but
his wife is taking his drugs
she's so addicted to them that she'll
dig them out of the toilet
neil breen decides in his neil brain
wisdom that he doesn't need his drugs
anymore
but neil breen is also talking to a
different psychiatrist
who is an old woman and doesn't have an
office but instead has two folding
chairs
and she tells neil breen that he is a
special magical child
who was destined to have the magic space
rock
and the milbreen meets his friend from
10 and 40 years ago
because she's so they go back into the
woods and they both reborn
it's the thing and the cube into the
jewelry box which turns back into a
mushroom yes and his wife dies
and then later on neil brain still has
the cube
even though he buried the cube and it
vanishes what but then in a later scene
after that where we see an alarm clock
the cube is back
on his nightstand but the cubicle
vanishes
again oh and oh by the way i forgot neil
breen
is an author but he's also the world's
best computer hack
why not and he's writing a book but he's
not
really writing a book no he is in fact
hacking
all of the thing
rich it goes without saying that neil
breen is the world's greatest
computer hacker that goes without saying
you didn't even need to mention that
this is a neil breen movie
so this whole time neil breen has been
hacking
the world yes to get the information
that would hurt the governments but the
governments don't want billbrain to have
the information
so after neil his wife russian wife
commits suicide
after she betrays him and gives all of
his hacking secrets
his psychiatrist who's in power for
somebody who's in power for some reason
then she kills herself by taking the
pills that she took
out of the toilet when she drinks down
presumably not with toilet water we hope
who knows
so this leaves nilbrain free to have a
new wife
yes who is his 10 and 40 years ago best
friend
she's no longer fiance by the government
i'm not ready for this but fortunately
he also drops a note
that tells neil brade exactly where
he's taking his new wife very slowly so
neil brain goes there
where he turns intangible walks through
a wall
and instead of untying her wife he takes
her blindfold off then
back on so that the new wife doesn't see
him
turn them both intangible where they
walk out of the building
he has power and and then the last 10
minutes of the movie
happens and we were all very happy
my one tiny nitpick is you forgot about
the ghost
that was also nearby oh yeah there was a
ghost
there was so many nuances neil breen
ghost
knew that his lady psychiatrist was also
a ghost when he met with the three
ghosts in the desert to read the ghost
book
here's the thing that's my titans are
they affiliated with the
the turning animal skeleton
what was up with the ghost king the
ghost cake
oh my god there's a ghost cake that's a
book it's not an actual cake it's a book
and we decided
it looks like a cake it very much looks
like rich what was up with the with the
garbage room
oh that's right yeah i forgot about the
garbage bags you missed so much uh we
lost rich
he lost he's gone he's done
okay if we are going to dissect this
movie as if it were an
actual movie let's don't forget this is
what we are going to do
to do what i believe neil breen
is trying to say is after a near-death
experience he re-prioritized his life
i'm with jack on this one
they normally put the oxygen mask over
gauze that's covering your entire face
after after that i think the entire film
is a bit of a metaphor
for kind of reevaluating your life
that's when neil breen says hey
publisher i'm not meeting your deadline
no more books
these [ __ ] time books signing these
books because i'm so
famous oh i didn't even write them
oh yeah bob woodward wrote them no more
damn
books no more books
i don't need these i'm not going to take
these anymore
your pill taking for pain relief has
gotten out of control
if i were if i were eating neil breen's
pills how would i do it
i wouldn't i would say this one's
for urinary incontinence
you're talking about real neo breeds
pills yeah that's the joke that's the
joke
he has he has fly he has flowmax and
yes he has like a like like like blood
pressure pills
yeah and like cholesterol anything for
his ego in there
no um nothing can check that nothing
maybe
some like you know little uh
psychologist you were not making
progress on your second book
i offered you medication that would help
you
i'm feeling less stable
josh tell us all about the 168 year old
man who has sex with a 16 year old girl
does
not he says no he says you are bad
and you get out of my pocket i don't
want this why do you keep swimming
topless in my swimming pool please do
not take a bubble bath in my house
you just love me i'm neil breen i'm i'm
i
i radiate sexually i know you want this
business but you have to leave
you have to 16 year old girl i'm 148
year old
this is not good
no no let's not do anything weird i hope
moving in stereo doesn't start playing
why why are you doing this yeah she's at
his house
that's the other guy's step daughter
yeah yeah dylan
she can't resist yourself so right i
mean
you should put that back on and you
should probably also leave
oh that's done okay i'll tell your
parents what you did today oh no
don't do it no
you had to take a bath after you were in
the pool for 20 seconds
getting freaked out why is she taking a
bath at their house uh you got to close
the drain before
emily you're home early
no this is weird he knows it's weird
yeah okay
but you also wrote that brain so you
know
but it's [ __ ] up well it's so poorly
executed if that's what's supposed to be
happening
oh she got distracted the 43 year old
russian
girl is too young for neil green
the 16 year old is far too young for
neil breen
so this is how we know that neil breen
is a good person
because anybody because he writes scenes
where he turns down 16 year olds when he
writes scenes that 16 year old girls are
attracted to him yeah
yeah how could you imagine that any
woman in the world would not be
attracted to neil brain
that's just not right he has gauze on
half of his face and he looks like dark
man
i don't like it but it's apparently a
fact maybe she was just attracted to all
of his laptops
ooh he's got so many he's got so many
laptops they're never turned on but no
they don't they don't work they don't
work not one of them but they're there
as a writer what would you use the other
laptops for
research research research research he's
researching a lot of stuff jack
government banks uh what else is he
trying to take
business government
businessman government research lies
true
true life jamie lacrosse corruption
true lies the movie he tries the movie
he just streams true
recall recall
all right back to work all right stay
away from me
oh my god
that was the scene a solid 80
of this movie is a relationship drama
where everybody's
kind of cheating on everybody else and
somebody wants to [ __ ] somebody
doesn't want to [ __ ]
and then somebody finds their true lost
love it's kind of a plus
like conspiratorial or uh
fantasy really better than his other
movies with i think all of his other
movies that we've watched it's really
kind of strewn throughout the movie
and he does allude to it now and again
which is like i'm doing research
i've got so much to do i'll never get
done
i'm going to continue hacking into these
government systems
to see what i can find out
about all this national and
international corruption i know is going
on
this is a romantic drama is
and then all of a sudden at the very
end of the movie after the romance plot
is
is concluded he holds a press conference
and then
everybody [ __ ] kills themselves what
the [ __ ]
it's brilliant it's [ __ ] brilliant
i want to be honest with all of you

payoffs and greed who are you always the
prize
editor of my company like many companies

all right happy 100 everybody
we can be done now we never have to
watch another movie i think we've done
it
it's probably the most coherent movie
neil breen has made to date
it's just the division it's the clear
division it's the clear division of
love story libertarian fantasy
and it's right but the fact that you
said clear division
is something you've never been able to
say in relation to neil breen before
that is true
that is true um well i don't know if we
can really do a best of the worst
we can't wow well it's
it's past it's as i say pass through i
mean it is
