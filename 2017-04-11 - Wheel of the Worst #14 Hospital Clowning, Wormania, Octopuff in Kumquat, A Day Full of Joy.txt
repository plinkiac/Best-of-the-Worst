Rich: Yeah, yeah, guys, I’m--I’m at the studio now, but none of the lights are working. Uh, I went to check the fuse box but-- agh--some kind of weird accident happened [The Wheel of the Worst sneaks up behind Rich] it looks like somebody smashed it in...with like a giant...wheel [Turns around, drops the cell phone] Oh no...Oh no! OH NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Mike: Well...we said it was dead, but it came back to life...just like Bob Hope [Rich stares blankly] Do you remember when Bob Hope...c--clawed out of his coffin at his own funeral? It wasn’t--widely reported in the media, I think the family was a little embarrassed they had [Whispers] prematurely buried him [Rich doesn’t say anything] Don’t ever join an improv group. Jesus fucking Christ!
R: [Turns to the guys behind the cameras] Line!
M: Anyways, the Wheel of the Worst is back! Let’s discuss the tapes that will torture us today, first up...uh, this is an old favorite...the only repeat on--on today’s Wheel, we brought it back in the hopes of landing on it, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Wormania! Live Worms and Song!
R: Well that’s just great, that’s just amazing. Next we have Surfing for Seniors!
M: So many broken...broken hips and shark bites
R: “An introduction to the internet”
M: [Disappointed] Ohh. I would rather watch seniors try and surf
R: I was hoping that’s what it was
M: That would be really--especially if one had an oxygen tank on the back of the surfboard
R: Throw their balance completely off?
M: Yeah, and they just go “ahhh!” we never saw Harold again
R: The whole thing, nobody successfully surfs, they all wipe out instantly
M: Rich...as a senior yourself, why do you hate your own kind? [Silence] Next up, is a tape that’s all red...for blood, why, it’s Riding Mower Safety
R: Written in pen...so we--we kind of worked--kind of taking on faith that that’s what’s in this box, this could be a snuff film
M: Yes
R: So I’m--I’m hoping we land on that
M: We came from your, uh, your home, so there’s a good chance of--
R: Next up is Hospital Clowning! Presented by J.T. “Bubba” Sikes
M: Uh...
R: They gonna tell us about the demon Eloisecole?
M: Possibly, one--the--they all worship her...their--their god of death
R: The--the--the cult? The cult is spreading? Its sequel?
M: [Nods] Hmm-mm
R: We can only hope. We can only hope, Mike
M: Gonna make them all wear black Nikes, and--and drink cyanide
R: [To the camera] Welcome to our comedy video--next up is The Rejection Connection!
M: Oh, you should know a lot about this!
R: How did I--how did I...know that was coming?
M: Tell me all about this video, Rich
R: The fucking--the fucking most obvious fucking thing you could’ve done! Jesus fucking Christ!
M: What, are you from Brooklyn now?.....You gonna try to sell me a hotdog? [Rich drops his head] Next up, Casual Slipcovers…”Create a beautiful new look in minutes!” 
[There’s silence, the camera switches between Mike, the tape, and Rich] (?)
[Rich begins to turn the Wheel slowly]
M: [Chuckles] Why are you--why are you doing it slowly like--like I’m gonna wanna stay on that. Oh no, please! Please, don’t go to the next tape! You’re gonna trick me. This is all you
R: [Reading the next tape] Meet Joe Cowley in--
M: “Joy”
R: I said “Joy,” didn’t I? [5 seconds ago] Meet Joe Cowley in [Slowed down] Meet Joe Cowley in--[Gotcha! appears on screen] Oh, fuck me, Joy Cowley in A Day--
M: Did you just say fuck--fuck me…?
R:...Full of Joy
J: Fuck me Joy Cowley
M: Yeah...can we just make a note that Rich just said fuck me Joy Cowley
R: Oh, fuck me, Joy Cowley in--
M: And! Let’s go one step further and photoshop their faces onto a pornographic image….Well, Rich, let’s talk about this in all seriousness, “Meet Joy Cowley in A Full Day of Joy,” uh, it’s made by The Wright Group...and apparently, this is Joy, she looks very happy, she has a cartoon possum...kissing her
R: A mole or something
M: She has a cat and a doll? [Shrugs] So maybe this lady is just so...so fucking charismatic she deserves her own video
R: I don’t know, I don’t know--all this time talking about tapes we’re not gonna land on ‘cause we’re gonna land on American Lung Association, Item number 6224 Octopuff in Kumquat [Mike laughs and looks at the ceiling] Nine minutes eight seconds
M: Alright, uh, clearly the most exciting tape we’ve come upon
J: Wait, I didn’t hear that, what’s the name of the tape?
R: The name is American Lung Association Item number 6224 Octopuff in Kumquat [Mike huffs] Nine minutes eight seconds
M: Hah…[Shakes his head]
Josh: Octopuff AND Kumquat or Octopuff--
R: Well, what--
M: In…
JH: In kumquat
M: Kumquat
R: What is an Octopuff?
M: Well, I’m gonna--I’m gonna extrapolate--
R: Is that some kind of Pokemon?
M: Octopuff….it--it’s--concerning it has the word “puff” in the title...maybe it is a...a drug? Like a thing you take when you have lung cancer?
R: I think--are they they’re gonna teach kids not to smoke by using, like, knockoff pokemon? Like “this is Octopuff. Octopuff has horrible lung cancer”
M: He smokes eight cigarettes 
R: He…[Laughs]
M: [Makes a croaking(?) noise] It’s, uh--well, the box--
R: Gotta catch all….the cancer…if Octopuff is an octopus that smokes, I don’t want to know what the fuck a kumquat is
M: Rich, I think you’re getting a little too creative here, I’m going with...with standard, I do not think we’re gonna see an octopus smoking eight cigarettes
[A clip from Octopuff in Kumquat plays with a cartoon octopus smoking a cigarette]

[7:38] JT Sikes: Hospital clowning is a viable ministry effort
M: Oh no!
R: Noooooooooo!!!
M: NOOOOOOO!!! [Jay laughs] We’re stuck, Rich!

[8:35] [Josh spins the Wheel, it lands on Wormania]
JH: Oooh…
J: Oh my god, it’s Wormania! With Mary Appelhof and the Brennan kids!
M: Woohoo!
J: You--you--you’re a music guy, you know the Brennan kids
JH: I sure...do…..let’s…
J: And Mary Appelhof!
JH: Oh...she’s, she’s a worm woman…
J: Wormania!

[9:24] J: Oh no! It’s Mary Applebee

[9:30] J: Eugh….
M: Ew what is that?
J: It’s just a bunch of worms fucking
M: So it’s an orgy?
J: A worm orgy. A wormgy

[9:47] M: Are they adding that waviness? Or is it the worms doing…
J: That’s the worms
M: I’m gonna throw up

[10:06] J: There’s the light
M: Haha!

[10:19] M: Ooh, a worm is a disgusting creature that lives to eat bacteria. Thanks, grandma. This is our last chance
JH: Oh ok
M: Spin number 3. I’m hoping for Octopuff in Kumquat. Or possibly a film about how elderly people can use the internet [Josh gives the camera two thumbs up, Mike spins the Wheel]
M: That was...I didn’t have a good (?) grip
JH: No, it’s ok
M: OCTOPUFF IN KUMQUAT!!!!
JH: (?)
M: I DID IT!!!! 
JH: YES! [Mike rips the tape off the Wheel] 
M: [Pushes the Wheel]
[Mike and Josh walk away, Rich approaches the fallen Wheel]
R: No! 
JH: Oh fuck
R: No!! No! It’s--it’s gone! This is beyond fixing! [Points at Mike] What--what the fuck did you do?!
M: It’ll--we can fix it, Rich
R: [Yelling] Was it fucking worth Octopuff in Kumquat?!
M: Yes!! Yeeesss! [Runs away]

[12:01] [At the table] 
[Josh plays a guitar]
M: [Singing] I got a worm in my *bleep* I got a worm in my *bleep* My worm’s gonna go in the *bleep* My worm’s gonna go in the *bleep* Rich Evans wants my worm in his *bleep* He’s always asking for my worm in his *bleep* [Almost laughing] He gets uncomfortable when he asks me for a--those questions--he gets uncomfortable when he asks me these questions…
[Silence]
[Josh, Mike, and Jay laugh]
R: So…[Josh laughs louder than before, Jay puts his head down]....on this final episode...of Wheel of the Worst…
J: Our second annual final episode
R: [Chuckling] Our second annual final episode Wheel of the Worst...we…
M: Even though the Wheel is destroyed…
J: It’s in pieces
JH: Oh my god
J: We should point out, I guess we can show photos of it, it cracked right down the middle, of not only the backboard, but the Wheel itself...right down the center, and it’s all because of that pin, I guess
M: Yeah...there was a bolt that was sticking out of the back, because of the...adjustments...modifications that were made--
R: Well, it’s not just modifications, that’s the spoke
M: Yes
R: That’s the way the Wheel turns, it’s necessary
M: Yes, yes, and for you Wheel of the Worst historians out there, there was a Wheel before this
R: Yeah
M: That was, uh, half--two--two different types--
R: Only the face, like, the actual base has been the same
J: The Wheel was changed
M: Yes
R: This is...irreplaceable [Jay snickers] And now it is broken
M: But there was, uh, an incident where the Wheel of the Worst was knocked over prior to this by Jack Packard [Flashback to episode 5 when Jack pushed the Wheel over] 
R: And that makes it okay
M: And that….made…
R: That makes it okay because Jack Packard did it?
M: Yes
R: If--if--if--if Jack would jump off a bridge, would you also jump off a bridge?
M: I would, yeah
J: I think what Mike is getting at is that, this right here it’s Jack’s fault
[Mike and Josh say “yeah” at the same time]
J: Yeah
M: He set the precedent that it was okay to knock the Wheel over and I did it
R: You know what--you know what Jack didn’t do…[Picks up the Hospital Clowning tape] He didn’t watch Hospital Clowning
JH: That’s true
J: I wish he would have, could’ve given us some valuable insight
R: He might’ve liked Hospital Clowning because Jack’s a fucking clown weirdo

[15:24] J: There was--there was a point early on where we were like, “ohh this is a backdoor Jesus video”
JT Sikes: How hard it’s gonna be a gospel clown or a hospital clown...
M: Rich...what’d you do?

[15:48] R: This--this--this exists for deathbed conversions

[16:17] R: This Jesus buck costs two real bucks

[16:22] R: Is that a bigfoot?
M It was supposed to be a clown but he was too cheap to get color printing

[16:50] M: That’s the weird thing is we’re so, so affected by cynicism with videos...we’re like “what’s the angle? When’s he gonna do this, when’s--” and then really--
JH: Right
M: It seems like it may have come from a genuine place, which is...very rare

[17:43] R: Good work, cameraman. Nice work, makeup job(?) They’re completely…
J: They’re completely uneven
JH: What the fuck?
J: You suck!!!

[18:53] M: Well, that’s a weird...angle to it, as well, is he kind of...is like he’s talking to children, but really he should be talking very adult, “you gotta call up the hospital, you gotta talk--” and he’s like “call the administrative office and tell ‘em hoo hah hey!” you know, and it’s like--it’s like who are you talking to? Who’s your audience, is it little kids or is it like, rational adults who aren't pedophiles who want to go to a children’s hospital to be a clown
R: How many instructional videos that tell you how to be a clown hospital are there?
J: I don’t think we’ve watched a single video that told us how to be a clown hospital
JH: I would like to see that
R: Oh my god
J: I would like to see that, yeah
JH: I completely do want to see that
M: Not many patients come out alive from a clown hospital [Jay laughs] But ironically, they can fit a lot of patients in a clown hospital
J: A clown hospital is where…
R: It’s--it’s--it’s quantity, not quality
M: What? How did you get my joke?
R: Huh?
J: A clown hospital is like, where they--they cut you open for surgery and they just start pulling out, like, handkerchiefs
R: They give you a heart transplant, which is just like, a balloon heart
JH: Ohh
J: Which we see in the video

[21:47] [Mike touches each of the tapes] M: Out of our three villains…[Everyone bursts into laughter]

[22:05] R: Well, the next movie that the Wheel landed on, not that it’s a movie of any kind, is Wormania...and I don’t know, just because there’s music in it, Josh…[Gives him the tape]
JH: Sure
R: Tell us about Wormania 

[23:51] M: Eww I wanna throw up

[23:56] JH: Where’s mom?
M: The mom--
J: She left, they couldn’t stop singing about worms
JH: Fair enough

[24:52] R: But she--she loves worms so much, she is completely oblivious to the fact that everything in this video is absolutely disgusting

[26:57] J: “Eat it”

[27:28] Mary Appelhof: James, will you please fill this balloon with water?
James: [Seductively] Gladly
R: Whaaaat?!
J: [Laughs] What the fuck was that?
R: Yeah
M: “Say the line again, just more sexually...more sexually charged”
J: Oh god, everything about this is disgusting

[28:19] M: I’m(?) gonna throw up
(...)
M: Don’t zoom in

[28:48] [Mike slowly pulls up a giant gummy worm from under the table]
J: And it’s just like, slimy and disgusting and it’s just really gross
M: It was--it was so, so disgusting, I know [Takes a bite out of the gummy worm]
JH: What the--
J: What is--what do you have there?
M: Hmm? Oh, it’s the world’s largest gummy worm
JH: We’re still talking about--
M: Is it weird that--
J: We’re talking about worms having sex and being covered in mucus
M: Ok...I’m sorry--I--is it distracting? You can keep talking
R: It looks tough, don’t you have to, like, tenderize that?
M: Well, yeah, I guess so
R: Yeah, just...just get that...yeah
[The worm is now pixelated, Mike is squeezing and pulling the gummy worm]
M: [Under his breath] Yeah, that’s right [Jay looks in the opposite direction] Oh wh--wh--what side is the anus?
R: Uhh--
M: Does it matter?
R: It can be ei--I don’t know, it’s probably--one of the other
M: It’s not very specific
R: Yeah
M: Well just to be sure I’ll eat both ends
[Rich and Josh laugh]
R: Oh my god…
J: I think I’m gonna barf
JH: Oh jeez
[One end of the gummy worm touches Jay’s arm]
J: Ahh, don’t let it touch me! 
[Mike throws the worm on Jay, he throws it off in a hurry]
J: Ahhh!
JH: Ohhh
[Rich giggles]
[Silence]
M: I’m sorry, you were talking about worms?

[30:07] R: So, the last video, uh, the Wheel landed on, ever...was, uh, Octopuff and Kumquat
JH: In Kumquat
R: In Kumquat
JH: That’s important
R: Was it worth it, Mike?
[Mike just looks down, Rich looks back at the Wheel]
R: Jay…[Picks up the Octopuff tape] would you like to tell us about A Day Full of Joy?

[32:08] R: [Monotone] And the meanies walked on the ceiling. And the meanies walked on the ceiling. And the meanies walked on the ceiling--
M: Shut up!
J: What happened ne--
JH: No!
R: And Mike said shut up
M: Shut up!
R: And Mike said shut up. And Mike said shut up

[33:56] J: Well, the entire time she’s talking about her eight cats, there’s like, a little thought bubble showing the cats, but, like, blocking the foreground, right in front of her, is like a giant goat?
JH: Sheep
M: It’s a sheep
J: Oh, was it a sheep? I couldn’t remember, ok
JH: Jay, do you not know the difference between a sheep and a goat?
J: I don’t--I just didn’t remember
R: You fuck ‘em both

[34:34] J: I hope she gets eaten by a weta

[35:32] R: Me, me, me, me, me!!

[35:43] M: Other than elderly people, uh, that are full of themselves that we hate, the running theme of this episode is “what is the point of these videos?”

[36:41]  M: Joy takes you into a forest and shows you dirt

[37:32] M: Is it a video made by a crazy kiwi?
R: Yes

[38:24] JH: And they’re like “you gotta have something to talk about,” “well, we went bungee jumpeen”
M: Josh, Josh…
JH: Trying to get to the truth
M: You got--no, no, no, you, the--I’m talking--you got the--accent--you got it there for a second
JH: “Bungee jumpeen”?
R: Bungee jumping
M: Rich--Rich--Rich is just doing Australian
JH: Got a  lot of cats
R: I know, I can’t do accents
JH: See, I’m gonna do it, yeah, “I got a lot of kets, and we went bungee jumpeen”
M: Yes, yes, bungee jumping. It’s--it’s got a bit of the higher end, huh-ey--
JH: No, you’re still--you’re losing it
M: [Stammers] Slip into the British cockney a little bit                        
(...)   
M: Fuck you, Joy!

[39:45] J: Oh, our bulb just died
R: Everything’s fucking breaking!
J: Oh my god--Remember the other two times that we said that the Wheel was never coming back and it came back because people seem to believe the things that we say?
R: It’s never been fucking bisected before, Jay
M: It got…
R: It’s gone!
M: Remember?
J: It’s gone forever and the Wheel will never come back, ever again!
JH: There’s no possible way for us to find a way to fix it or replicate it, it’s not possible, it’s not like anybody here made it with their own bare hands. It just appeared one day. There’s no way we’re getting this thing back

[42:37] R: It went out like a bitch
