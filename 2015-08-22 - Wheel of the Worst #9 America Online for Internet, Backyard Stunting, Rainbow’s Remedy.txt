[0:36] [Mike peeks out from behind the Wheel, walks to the front of the Wheel]
M: Hello! And welcome to another episode of Best of the Worst. I’m Mike! [Slight pause] On this episode we welcome two professional VFX artists, who are coming here all the way from Canada. You might remember them as Jim and Colin. They’ll be doing ALL, and I mean ALL the visual effects in this episode. What? What’s that? I think I hear them flying in now
[Jim and Colin are standing in front of a green screen pretending to “fly;” there is an explosion; they “land” beside the Wheel; when they change cameras, they’re wearing different clothes]
M: Wow! That was amazing, guys! 
Colin: Nice (?)
M: I--I just--it was so, so believable
C: You can do amazing things with computers these days, Mike
M: You sure can. Now let’s watch terrible VHS tapes
Jim: That sounds great!
M: Okay....uh, what’s on the wheel today? Jim, what’s our first film? ‘Cause I don’t wanna talk about rape
JM: The first film is about--”Fierce and Female: Practical Rape Defense Tactics for Every Woman”
M: Every woman? [There is a picture of an appendage-less woman onscreen]
JM: [Continues reading] With Melissa Soalt aka Doctor Ruthless
M: Is that a play on Doctor Ruth, the sex therapist? [Jim doesn’t answer] Ummm what--what do you expect to see on this?
JM: I don’t want to see it, but I--I assume it’s defense tactics 
M: [Chuckling] “Don’t want to see it--”well, looks like she’s trying to gouge his eyes out
JM: I think so
M: I guess that’s fair. Alright, next up: Your Cat Wants a Massage. Uh, “your whiskers to tail guide to cat massage. Hosted by Maryjean Ballner and Champion.” I guess Champion is the name of the cat. Uhh, wow
C: That looks awful
M: Uhh, uhh, I guess massaging a cat is a thing?....Have you ever heard of that?
C: No
JM: It says “as seen on TV,” do you think it was really on TV?
M: I think that’s--that means the tape was sold on TV 
JM: Oh. Oh ok
M: Probably in between, uh, Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune 
JM: Right
M: “I ordered a tape with instructions on how to rub my pussy, but I got this.” Completely, completely misleading advertising. I just--I don’t know, I figured I’d be the first to go there
Rich: [From behind the camera] How many--how many sex shops accidentally ordered thousands of copies?
M: And then they just had to use the VHS tape as a very awkward dildo. That’s the only use for it
C: Terrible. How can they tell your cat wants a massage?
M: I don’t think a cat would be very cooperative during a massage, it’d probably just try to claw your eyes out. Right?
C: Kind of like, uh, Fierce and Female
M: Right, yeah [Somebody photoshopped the cover of the tape to read: Fierce and Feline: Practical Rape Defense Tactics for Every Cat with an image of an angry cat on it]
M: Well, I, uh, what’s next, Colin?
C: America Online for Internet. It’s from the Video Tutors Institute 
M: Also known as VTI
C: Is that a thing?
M: No
C: It also has Chinese lettering on the other side of the box, so I have a feeling this is gonna be really really boring 
JM: It has a satellite dish, which looks like it’s based in Ontario
M What’s next?
JM: Zig Ziglar presents Courtship After Marriage: Romance Can Last A Lifetime. Two powerful segments”
M: Uhhh…
JM: Two powerful segments. So it--it must--maybe two themes? Two separate themes? 
M: [Stammering] I couldn’t tell ya
JM: Well maybe he gets married again (?) I don’t know. Another segment after the (?) “Romance can last a lifetime” he’s sitting, she’s kneeling
M: Yeah, he’s prepping her for…
JM:...Disappointment?
M: Yeah, that’s it. He’s prepping her for two powerful segments. I really don’t know
[Jim turns the wheel slowly, the camera slowly zooms in on the Rainbow’s Remedy tape; an ominous song plays]
M: Umm our next tape, is called Rainbow’s Remedy with Rainbow the Clown. Uh, “creative resources for death education.” Uhh [Grabs the tape and rips it off] I’m sorry, but this--
C: We need more details
M: Rip the thing out of the wheel of the worst, let’s read the back. “Rainbow the Clown gently guides the viewer through the stunning shock and emptiness. The utter despair and seemingly unending sorrow experienced following the death of a loved one”
C: Oh my god
M: With a clown. “Eloise Cole is a nationally recognized bereavement specialist, she travels wide--widely, lecturing on dying, death, grief, bereavement, pain, suffering, torture, heartache, depression, suicide--”
C: Are you reading that off of…?
M: No
C: That’s seriously there?
M: “Suicide…” 
C: Torture?
M: “Child abuse...” Yeah, it’s all on here [Camera zooms in on Eloise Cole’s face; a scratchy(?) violin plays] Uh, uh, Colin? What’s our next video?
C: “Action by Design in association with Reel Stunts Productions presents Randy Butcher’s Backyard Stunting: Hits and Misses. A video guide for stunting for the amateur filmmaker, featuring performances by professional stuntman, Randy Butcher”
JM: That sounds exciting. Action-packed, but hits and misses? So maybe he’s showing the stunts that don’t work out
M: I hope so
JM: Could be entertaining. It could be--
C: Instructional, I think. But, like, the funny thing was, when I took a look at the cover, you probably think this was made in like, 1980...3 or something like that. It’s like 1995
M: Oh my god. Oh my god
C: Yeah, so…
M: Alright! What’s our next video tape?
JM: Uh, Safe Food Attitude: What moms-to-be need to know about safe food handling. Featuring the kickin’ rap group 2-B Moms
M: Oh, 2-B Moms, yeah…
JM: Yeah, I missed the--”Get With A Safe Food Attitude.” “Get WIth A” but it’s buried--
M: Yeah 
JM: It’s hard to--hard to read
M: They did a bad job, making that cover 
C: Why is kickin’ in quotes? The “‘kickin’’ rap group”
M: Oh, I think it’s a pun, like, the babies are kicking
Both: Ohh!
JM: It is clever. They don’t look pregnant. Oh, I guess she does. 
M: Well, they’re hiding their pregnancy in their giant overalls 
JM: Right. And they, uh, there’s a broad spectrum of races
M: Yeah, it’s very, very diverse
JM: Hmm-hmm. I guess...I don’t know, I guess they’ll just be washing their hands the whole time or something
M: Yeah
JM: Keeping food in the fridge (?)
M: They should’ve watched a video called A Safe Sex Attitude. [Jim and Colin snicker] So they wouldn’t be fucking knocked up
C: Safe Penis Handling
M: Safe Penis Handling. Yes please, keep turning
C: “Who’s In Charge?” And the dog’s holding his hand up and he says ruh-uhh and then he’s holding a human...this is--this cover’s amazing. Uh...he’s holding a human, I don’t know what’s happening, he’s standing on their house
M: Oh yeah, He’s standing on the house
C: Standing on the house. He’s saying “I’m in charge,” he’s holding a human and she’s got an expression on her face, I don’t know what--she’s choking, if she’s vomiting--
JM: And she’s touching the dog’s pee-pee
C: [Laughing] She is…
M: Oh yeah
C: Uhh yeah, so I guess, and it says “No more! No more barking, wetting, jumping, chewing, digging, couch, and dogs”
JM: Couch--I think it’s couch dogs
M: Yeah, couch dogs. What a bizarre cover
C: Hmm-hmm, it’s really weird
JM: It looks like it’s been heavily inspired by Zack Snyder’s 300 
M: I’m sure every tape on here is a living nightmare. Except for maybe the cat massage...I don’t...I always wanted to massage a little cat. Have him try and claw my eyes out
C: No, you’re thinking of Doctor Ruthless
M: There might be some eye-gouging in this (Courtship After Marriage) too, if the courtship doesn’t go well. Or marriage
C: Will probably want to gouge your eyes out after watching this (Rainbow’s Remedy)
M: Maybe that’s what the clown does to demonstrate, like, horror, pain, and death, is she gouges her own eyes out in front of children
JM: Maybe, or maybe she’s just seeing--
M: “This is what death looks like”
JM: I hope we get to see her without her makeup
M: I hope so, too. Actually, that is her without her makeup. That’s her pre-clown

[10:32] Jay: Think I just heard his chair creak
C: Yeah, I heard that, too
(...)
Rich: Well, this is China, that’s not the chair, it’s like, the people with the guns
M: “You make the video”
R: Can’t leave until he’s done
[Opens “compose mail,” “To: Asylum@FBI.gov, Subject: HELP!!, File: HELP!! My Government is forcing me to make AOL Training videos against my own will!!! SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM!!!” is written in the corresponding boxes]

[11:13] C: Well, that was exactly as miserable as I expected 
R: Let’s never do this again
JM: Ok. Wait! We have to--we have to watch another one. Let’s watch one more
C: Come on, wheel of the worst! [Spins] 
JM: Go, wheel!
[A tape falls off and slams onto the ground, making “debris” fly up]
[It almost lands on Rainbow’s Remedy, but it “magically” moves in the opposite direction, landing on Backyard Stunting]
All: Ohhh! Yay!

[12:08] [Randy Butcher pretends to pass out then suddenly wakes up]
RB: Hi! I’m Randy Butcher
[Jay and Colin laugh]
M: Oh my god, he fooled us all! 

[13:29] C:“For extra protection, use a ball gag”

[13:32] R: “All right, the neck’s been stretched, let’s jump off that roof!” [Pronounces it like “ruff/rough”]

[13:35] M: “Try to get your partner on all fours at all times.” That’s why this was in an abandoned warehouse 
R: “Pants might get in the way of a good shot” 

[13:52] R: Well, that was Backyard Stunting: Hits….and Misses. So, uh, what--[Jay runs in and pretends to beat up Rich, with Rich yelling out in pain for an uncomfortably long time, Jay makes a slight punching gesture and Rich stumbles out of the scene, Jay takes his place next to the wheel]
J: Alright, guys, we got one more spin
JM: Let’s do it!
J: Alright, let’s make it count
JM: Alright
[Lands on Who’s In Charge]
J: The episode is not saved

[15:03] [Rich gets up in the middle of watching Who’s In Charge, goes to the wheel and grabs Rainbow’s Remedy]

[15:24] M: That was fucking frightening
R: That was a clown without makeup

[15:29] Rainbow: Hi! I’m Rainbow, I’m a clown, I came today to share a story from a while ago
R (?): [Imitating Pennywise] “Down here we all float”

[15:49] [Camera slowly pans from left to right over the group]

[16:03] R: “Now I’m filled with pain! Hidden just under the surface!”

[18:06] C: Rich called it, like, I knew, as soon as he saw this video, and decide whether to put it on the wheel, that it was gonna be miserable. I mean--just look at the--the cover and there’s just something about it I could tell it was like, very long, and then right before it started playing, Rich said, “what if it’s in Chinese?”
M: And he was right

[18:33] JM: There’s a lot of English text, like a lot of Engr--English text…
M: Did you just say “Engrish”?

[19:00] M: [Listing off words that are untranslatable in the Asian language the video was in] Democracy. Freedom
JM: Internet communications or something like that?
R: Freedom of the press

[19:32] R: Still waiting for like, the still image where it explains how to hack into the CIA network

[20:10] R: Right around 1996, my--my uncle walked into my room drunk, insisting I teach him the internet. And he phrased, I--”teach me the internet”
M: Well, that’s better than insisting he show you his Wendy’s ad [Referencing Wheel of the Worst episode #8, at 23:23] [Colin laughs] I mean, you just walked right into it!
[Silence]
R: It ain’t right. It ain’t right [Jay laughs in the background]
[Jim laughs] JM: Jay is just like, dying
M: Well, tell us more about this
R: [Stammering] That’s--that’s the whole story, it’s f--
M: Were his pants on?

[20:46] [Mike gets a stepladder, places it in the middle of the screening room and climbs it]
M: Don’t mind me
R: I think it’s ok, I don’t see a rope

[21:03] JM: Maybe...one other thing I noticed, that--that...I was kind of waiting and hoping that it would show up, is--for some reason, one of the drop down menus said Jurassic Park
M: Yes
JM: He didn’t click on that, because, obviously that’d be too entertaining and he just wanted to piss everyone off and not show Jurassic Park

[21:21] [Clips of Jurassic Park are interlaced(?) with clips of America Online]

[22:21] [Jim picks up the tape] JM: I just don’t understand why there’s a--a radar dish, uh, poised in Ontario
C: ‘Cause that’s where the internet comes from
R: --it beams the internet. That’s the internet machine
C: It beams it out and it comes around a green... (?)
JM: It’s an honest question
R: Didn’t you know there’s a giant satellite dish, that makes the internet?
M: Are these--are these two things to scale?
C: Ehh, pretty much. It is pretty big 
M: Is this El Nino?
JM: Well the--you can see the satellite dish from the CN Tower
C: Uh, yeah, it’s like the size of the one from Return of the Jedi
JM: Right, so CN Satellite Dish

[22:53] M: Well, there’s a phone number on the back, for Video Tutors Institute
JM: Shhh, Mike’s dialing
[Rich is holding the cellphone up to his ear, an automated message is heard]
AM: “The (???) you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone” 
[Rich starts yelling in “Chinese,” Colin turns red from laughing so much, Jim hides his face in his hands]
R: Taskbar! Flashbar! Wubba wubba! [Turns off phone and hands it back to Mike]
M: Thanks
C: This racism is killing me
R: That’s not racism!......They talk like that! [Colin laughs]
M: Rich is right, they did talk like that in the video
C: They did
M: It’s a pretty accurate impression
JM: Well, it was--it was a different era
C: It was
JM: (???) just changed
C: That was the 90s

[24:14] R: Gandalf came and saved us

[24:39] R: How much does a gopher weigh?
M: What?

[26:01] C: You know what else shows up a lot in this video? Is, uh, acid washed denim 
JM: Yes
C: Mom jeans
JM: Mom jeans worn by men

[26:32] R: He’s serving up some meat
[Everybody, including Jay, laughs]
C: They should call it “Backdoor Stunting”

[26:46] M: There’s jokes in this episode, everybody, there’s jokes!

[26:51] JM: As soon as we started talking about…..I don’t know, it’s not homoeroticism, but as soon as...we...kinda threw that out there, suddenly everything’s like a euphemism

[27:28[ C: It’s like he’s peeing on him?
(...)
M: “Take it, Blair”

[28:12] [Mike puts his arm around Rich]

[28:34] JM: And--and there’s one stunt that he’s doing where he purposely puts his partner on all fours, and I was thinking--well, action movies, sure, there’s all kinds of arrangements. But why?

[29:52] JM: [Listing off the roles Randy Butcher had] Anal rapist #9
C: Guard…
M: Oh, hoho….
R: That wasn’t a role

[30:31] M: Innuendo: The Video

[31:06] R: How many people used this? Like, actually made their own movie and used these techniques, how--how many people?
M: Probably a lot of people watched this video, but they just started fucking guys They went in looking for stunt work, but--[shrugs]--things went a different way
R: “You can parlay the knee kick into a good night”

[32:05] C: [Looking at the back of the box] There’s--there’s more releases, uh, so he ends this one…
R: Seems like there are plenty of releases
M: I was….
C: These are the latest releases
M: Oh
C: “Randy Butcher’s Backyard Stunting 2: Falling for Effect”
[Mike snickers] R: “Falling onto my cock”?
C: And then “Backyard  Stunting 3: Home Brew SFX.” And I think maybe the F is supposed to be an E
M: Home Brew Sex?
R: Home Bro Sex?

[33:46] [In the screening room] [Mike and Rich are still holding onto each other]
M: Ok, that’s enough
R: Yeah, I think that’s good 
[They separate]

[38:37] Rainbow: I discovered journal-writing as a way to deal with my feelings, and you know, it really did--
M: “It rotted my face”

[39:26] R: I think--I think Eloise Cole is actually, like, the name of an ancient Mesopotamian death god. Everyone around her just starts dying

[39:59] C: And then they cut to that lady with the giant, like, head, it was like a beehive hairdo
JM: Or--or it was just a thin layer of hair masking an elongated skull
R: Well, her skull is turning into a wacky clown skull

[41:12] JM: The reason why her...her si--,you know, her side of the video was suspect, is because they didn’t follow, um...the interview with her, showing photos of her dead loved ones
M: Yeah
JM: So they--they didn’t have any--
M: There was no context
JM: Whereas, with the others, you saw the dead grandfather/father, and then with the--with the woman with the big glasses, they showed four or five horrific photographs of her six-week old baby that died, one of which has the baby hooked up to an aquarium

[42:03] R: “We’re out of blood, just hook it up to the aquarium!”
C: What was that about? I think they were trying to entertain him and they just sort of sat him in front of the aquarium, looking up, that--
JM: There’s a big line, there’s a line going up to the aquarium as if it’s--
M: Yeah, they were trying to turn him into a reptile

[42:16] R: My theory is, we have somebody who got some kind of...bullshit degree in therapy, and they think they’re a lot smarter than they really are, and they have this clown idea, which is stupid and useless, but she thinks she’s some kind of revolutionary therapist
JM: Hmm-hmm
R: That’s my theory
M: [Looks at the tape] Yeah. I don’t see an MD after that “Cole”
R: Yeah. She took a class once. 
C: Yeah
JM: I’m interested to read her poetry
R: She didn’t go to clown college, that’s for sure
JM: No, no, that’s a very good point--cheers. Very good point [He and Rich clink their glasses]

[43:47] R: “If you want your baby back, say the lines! Say the lines!!”

[45:24] M: Clearly a woman who’s filled with pain. And trying to share it with others

[47:09] [Jim blows into his bottle]
J: Eloise Cole is dead
[Colin suddenly laughs really hard]

[48:21] M: Jim? Your pick for best of the worst. Which--which--which video tape did you have the most, uh, enjoyment watching?
JM: I’d say light’s (???)...Butcher Action, what’s it called? Backyard Stuntman: Hits and Misses

[50:14] C: Yeah, it had like, you know, a kind of running gag
R: Don’t you mean a rutting gag?
[Silence, Jim snickers]
J: What?
M: What?
R: Rutting?
C: Rut--rutting?
J: Rudding?
R: Rut-ting
J: What does that mean?
R: You know, humping
J: Rutting?
C: What?
M: Is that a word?
J: You just made that up!
R: I--I--I think that’s a word
[Mike checks his phone]
M: “Rutting” is a word that means “humping”
C: I think it’s--I think it’s “rooting,” “rooting” is Australian for…
R: Maybe
C:...having sex
M: “A recurring period of sexual excitement--[Jim and Rich shake hands]--or reproductive activity”
J (?): What??
JM: Sorry I doubted you
R: It’s okay
C: I salute you
M: It took us 11 minutes and--and a dictionary to get your joke, but good job

[52:31] [Short clips of everyone play with a rock(?) song in the background]
