Mike: Hey everybody, it’s back! Tall, wide, and filled with nonsense! Why, it’s Josh! And also, the Plinketto board is back! On this episode of Best of the Wo-oeei-rst
Josh: Well Mike, we’ve got 10 movies to watch
M: We’re watching 10 movies?
JH: Well, we’ve got 10 movies to choose from
M: Oh that’s right
JH: Well, Mike, we’ve got 10 movies to choose from today. What do we have on the big board?
M: Well...um, oh dear god, it looks awful. We have Invasion Force
JH: Hmm-hmm. Umm...Kea...Kea...Keaton’s Cop
M: Uh...Cryptz, with a Z. “Terror...under the hood” Is it about a car?
JH: Yeah, probably. [Looks at next tape] Uh, Living to Die, which, aren’t we all? (???) that’s a slice-of-life picture
M: Perhaps, perhaps...uh, uh--
JH: “Some people play for money. Some people play for keeps”
M: I’d rather play for money
JH: Me too [Nods]
M: Space Raiders
JH: This one looks fun. I want to see this one
M: Yeah, I--you know, you know I used to see that box in the video store. But I never watched it
JH: No. Well, why would you?
M: And next, we have our player’s choice block, so if the Plinketto ball falls and hits the Player’s Choice box...you pick any video you want to watch!
JH: Any movie anywhere?
M: No, no, it has to be one on the Plinketto board unfortunately. Or else I would watch a video that’s 30 seconds long
JH: I would watch…
M: So then I could get out of here
JH: Oh that’s true. I would watch a movie that I had been meaning to watch for a while
M: That would also be a wise choice. I would pick anything BUT something on here, if I HAD a choice
JH: [Nods] So…
M: What’s next, Josh?
JH: Next up is The Survivor
M: Oh
JH: “Evil holds the key to freedom” Ellipsis
M: He crawled out of a hay barrel
JH: [Looks closer] Yeah. And there’s another one behind him
M: What a terrible, terrible cover
JH: It’s really awful
M: And again, we have Deathstalker 2. Which is, uh--for some reason, always on the Plinketto board. I don’t know why
JH: I--Are you sure that we can actually--
M: It might be--might be glued onto--[Josh removes it]
JH: Oh, no, it comes right off
M: We have complete freedom of choice to remove this, but for some reason…
JH: Shows up again, here it is. Next to that is Cyborg Soldier. Which definitely is not related to any other movie that came out at any time. It was a perfectly original idea.
M: It is, yeah, yeah...umm, oh god, Ice Cream Man. Which is Ron Howard’s bowel movement, starring as a child-molesting ice cream man. I can’t wait to watch that
JH: I, uh, I have like a vague memory of this one. I don’t know why I would’ve...why I remember it
M: Did it involve you being coaxed into the back of an ice cream truck?
JH: Not by Clint Howard 
M: Ok [Sort of chuckles] And lastly, Magic Kid [Long silence] Well, I can’t wait for the next 6 hours of my life. Josh, climb up on that ladder and let’s pick our first video tape to watch on the Plinketto board, episode 3. Alright Josh, it’s time to drop the ball and possibly pick a film that’s good

[4:13] M: Let’s see if we’ll survive The Survivor
JH: I’d like to apologize ahead of time. I have a bad feeling about this, but we’ll see what happens
M: Ok
JH: Alright, so having gone over--we talked a little bit about the front, with the terrible, terrible, terrible artwork, and the legend, “evil holds the key to freedom…” Quote! “Thrilling Intergalactic Terror!” Close quote. No attribution. Somebody said this, sometime
M: Hmm-mhm-hmm

[5:18] [Guy screams while making a derpy face, everybody laughs]
J: “Get this leaf blower off my face!”

[5:35] M: Kyla is such a little girl’s name 
JH: It is
M: He’s gonna get made fun of--maybe that’s why he became an intergalactic tyrant. Years, years of bullying

[5:52] Bad guy: Well, Mr.President….how nice of you to drop in [Henchmen laugh]
[Jack, Rich and Jay laugh along] JH: Not that funny, guys
JH: But he wants to conquer The Federation, so this is a Star Trek--
M: Oh, oh right
JH: You’re gonna love this. Alright. “His terrorist group has kidnapped the leader of the free world, the Federation President, and holds him captive in a barbaric jungle fortress--[Cut to a shot of Mike looking bored and uninterested, with his eyes half closed]--mankind’s destiny will be under Kyla’s tyrannical control unless The Survivor can outmaneuver him, liberate The President, and escape this doomed planet [Cuts to the same shot of Mike again] (???) So I feel like we got some, uh, some Escape from New York going on in here
M: The premise of this sounds quite epic and grand scale, I--I don’t doubt that there won’t be any kind of budgetary issues
JH: No
M: In terms of the quality of the product
JH: Certainly not by the graphics and pictures on the back. They definitely make it look like a very well-funded and uh, well thought-out film

[6:57] Prisoner: What do we get if we win?
Bad guy: Nothing
M: It’s a dumb question
[Shows scenes from the movie] M: Forty more minutes [Zooms in on Rich looking insanely bored]
M: I would expect nothing less from a movie I’ve never heard of
JH: Hmm-mm [Inspecting the box] Umm, it is presented in association with The Puerto Rico Investors Tax Credit
M: Oh! They’re my favorite film production company
JH: Me too
M: So, uh, it’s--it’s uh, oh wow, ok, so it’s a tax write off
JH: Oh yeah
M: It’s a scam, essentially

[7:53] M: Let’s go meet the guys in the screening room and watch The Survivor
Rich: We’re not in the screening room, we’re right here!
[Camera pans around to reveal the rest of the guys manning the cameras]
M: Oh gosh, I thought you guys were just nameless crew members. We don’t have any crew members

[8:46] J: The bomb’s not gonna go off, or something [There’s a huge explosion] Or they’re just gonna kill all the natives
[Rich cackles] JH: Kill them all
J: Wow
JH: Yeah
Jack: They don’t give a fuck, do they?
J: Thanks, Mr.President. At least your little asshole grandson’s ok
JH: Wrapped it up in a tight little (???)

[Back at the Plinketto board]  JK: Alright, Rich, it’s time to pick another movie, so, uh, someone toss me the ball [Someone tosses Rich the ball from behind the camera] 
[9:46] JK: So we got Keaton’s Cop
R: Ok, so at first I was a little bit disappointed, I was aiming for Space Raiders, but then, but then I noticed some things, I’m feeling a little more optimistic
JK: Right--[Cuts to clip of Rich in the screening room looking bored out of his mind]
R: Ok, we got an all-star cast. We got Lee Majors, Abe Vigoda, and Don Rickles, and, uh, the other thing, that’s a very positive sign, Cannon video. 
JK: Ooh, damn
R: So it’s a Cannon film--[Cuts to another clip of a bored Rich]

[10:51] JK: Why would you hire a hitman to murder an elderly person?
R: You just wait it out
JK: It’s just…[Laughs]
R: Really. Have you ever been to an elderly home? Those things are fucking...just--just deathhouses 
JK: Do you think they just hired like, a kindergartener to sneeze in there and that’s how--
R: [Laughs] I--I--you know, I don’t know..just--just bribe that one cat that hangs out with the old person before they die, ever hear about that one? [Jack just looks at the camera] “They quickly discover that Goldberg was a mistake, the real target is Louie Keaton (Abe Vigoda) another resident of the home, and a former mob member just released from prison.” So they fucked up. It’s a movie about incompetent assassins that kill the wrong elderly person in an old folks home
JK: This is beautiful! I love it already--[In the screening room, Rich covers his face with a cushion, flails around and goes limp]

[13:06] [Old people start singing, Rich looks up but continues looking depressed and bored]

[14:15] [Mike takes out his phone during an action scene]

[14:46] [Reading] M: “On a distant planet in a faraway future,” also know as “a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,” “a 10-year old boy,” the film’s target audience, “is about to become the unwitting captive of some ragtag intergalactic bandits.”
J: Oh my god, this sounds like the most original movie ever
M: This sounds boring. “For many youngsters, this might be a problem. For brainy, resourceful Peter Tracton, it’s the start of the greatest adventure a kid ever had.” [Mike looks at the camera](???)

[15:38] J: Oh, is that the kid in Over the Top? ‘Cause, uh, Stallone, he has to arm-wrestle for the custody of his child, that’s the child, apparently he lost the custody and now he’s forced to do shit like Space Raiders
M: I thought he was kidnapped by a band of intergalactic mercenaries

[17:36] [Kid blows up a rock/asteroid] J: Yay!
JH: Good job, kid!
M: Now, I have a feeling...could be wrong...towards the end he’s gonna use that--
J: You mean this isn’t just a random scene?

[17:56] [Guy in the movie gives the kid a beer and opens it for him] Guy: Have a beer, hot shot
Kid: God damn rocks!! [Rich, Jay, and Josh laugh]

[18:15] M: “Rated PG”
J: Oh, fuck! Do you think they had to put the--the Star Wars credit at the bottom of that just simply because they mentioned the name Star Wars in the description?
M: Yeah
J: That’s impressive
M: This is gonna suck. Who put this on here? This was not part of the picks from yesterday
J: Yeah, it was
M: Who snuck this on here?
J: I did not--
M: Tried to sabotage this program
J: You know what I did sneak on there, though, was Invasion Force, and we didn’t land on it
M: Bye
J: [Looks on the back of the Invasion Force tape, turns it to the camera] Look at this guy

[19:16] [Kid shoots an enemy ship] [Rich, Josh, and Jack cheer]
JK: Now drink their blood!
R: He loves it! He loves it!!
JH: He’s got a taste for it
[Mike comes back] M: So much ???
JH: He’s got a taste for murder now, Mike

[At the table] R: I know all the references. To the things. All of them
JH: All the most obscure references?
M: Do(?) you remember “I can smell your cunt”? [bleeped out]
R: No, I don’t. What’s that from, Mike?
M: Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock
R: I--what part--
M: It was also in Silence of the Lambs
R: Are you sure it wasn’t the porn parody Star Trek 3: The Search for Cock?
[Nobody speaks for 4 seconds]
JK: So today--[Josh laughs]--we quite possibly watched two of the most mind-numbing, boring movies ever, and Space Raiders
M: Yeah
JH: We reached a level, we definitely reached a level
JK: We reached a level, but first on the docket...hmmm, this is a tough responsibility, I’ve taken the reins, because I don’t feel like describing any of these movies [Josh is gritting his teeth trying not to laugh] so we’re gonna see if Mike can remember The Survivor [Mike looks up] Mike, tell us all about The Survivor.
M: Uh [Picks up tape]
JK: [Puts it down] There’s no reading the back of the box, Mike, you have to remember
M: No, no
JK: From memory
M: I was trying to get some clues. The Survivor was a thrilling intergalactic terror
JH: No, it wasn’t. It was not. It was not that
M: It’s--this is the Escape from New York movie, with Space Plissken, the pun Rich Evans was so proud of, that nobody cared about--
JH: I cared--I liked it, I liked it. Right here [Him and Rich high-five]
R: Thank you for your pity

[23:01] [Josh is naming all the main characters/actors in the Survivor, camera zooms in on Rich scratching his beard]

[23:20] M: And Bull, from Night Court, who plays a bad guy named Ki--Kesha?
JH: Kyla
M: A millennial ch--a millennial girl who’s--who’s 20, named Kyla, who’s always on her phone, but instead it was an eight foot tall man named Richard Moll. And he is the leader of, like, basically a post-apocalyptic gang of warriors, who live on Earth, who are criminals--
R: Oh god, this is so fucking boring!
[In the screening room, only Rich and Jay are left, Jay sighs]

[24:49] R: I can imagine people watching this--[Squints, make a confused sort of face]

[25:13] R: Does YouTube keep track of when people stop watching videos?
M: Yeah, they do. That’s right about now
JH: I’m sorry 
M: Good bye
R: Have a nice night everybody
JH: Thanks for watching Best of the Worst
M: Just check out now. Wait for the second ad break! Then check out
R: Put them both before this movie
M: There’s gonna be 32 ad breaks in the first 4 minutes of this film [Everybody laughs, Mike rests his chin on his hand]
JK: Ok
M: [Does a cutting/slicing motion] Oh my god, there’s so many ad breaks!

[25:54] [Rich grabs a cushion and sleeps on it]

[26:17] R: I apologize to Martin Mull, but at least we have some kind of humor now, because I mis-said his name

[27:17] M: This movie makes a fight scene look dull (?). How does it do that? How does it accomplish this cinematic feat?

[28:42] M: Kick him in the crotch. He’s just got a loincloth on. Kick him right in the junk. Kick him in the dick. Yes, there we go, finally
[There’s a close-up of Josh just staring at the tv, ZZZZZZZZ...appears]

[29:45] M: They just wanted to save themselves. Typical white people

[30:18] R: Probably just someone he raped. I mean, he was kind of a mean guy
JH: Don’t...we--we--we were--we were so close to getting through this whole fucking episode
M: We never said the R word, the whole day, Rich
JH You just spoiled it
JK: No, but you know what, you have to assume, with any Best of the Worst movie that there is at very least implied rape. That’s where I start the day, and hopefully it gets better, and it was, it was better, there was no rape until Rich brought us back down
Kyla: Wanna see how it works?
M: You could say he was doing a little night courting?

[30:59] JH: So we definitely had trouble with the timeline of what Earth was doing in this movie. [Camera slowly closes in on Rich] In terms of like, it was abandoned, then it was a penal colony 50 years ago, then “they” abandoned it. Someone says “they” abandoned it at some point, it was not really clear, as to what it is, we got like, a context clue [Mike looks at the camera]
R: [Into the microphone] No one gives a shit
[Mike leans back and covers his face, trying not to laugh]
JH: Goddammit, Rich

[32:35] JK: The main plot point of the movie, is that Lee Majors has a superpower, to locate every window in every building, and push bad guys out of ‘em

[32:51] R: Well, for the first part of the movie
M: Yeah, it doesn’t follow through
JH: No, it happens when he tries to push the one guy and he gets stuck on the fire escape
[Lee Majors runs in a hallway, pushes another man to the side, and shoots the bad guy]
[Anticipating another bad guy getting pushed out a window] 
Jack and Jay: Window? Window!
All: [Cheers]
JH: He barely even went out! He’s out, he’s out
R: Ok 
[Overlapping dialogue]
JH: Got the torso out
R: Technicality
J: He has to lift the legs up now so he falls
M: The damn fire escape ruined it
R: That’s when his power ended, that was the last one, that was all of the bad guy window juice he had
JK: Maybe it only regenerates if they hit the ground
M: His power regenerates every time he fucks his dog 
JK: Good ol’ Blue
M: Or that woman
R: So he has to fuck one of the dogs. It--it--it’s mean, it’s not even true. She’s not an unattractive woman
JH: No, she’s fine
R: I was trying to fit a joke in the--
M: Rich is just saying that because they both can lick their own crotch
Lady: I like your dog!
M: That was a deleted scene that Rich saw on the DVD version 
JH: It turns out Rich is an aficionado of Keaton’s Cop
M: So many deleted scenes--
R: That was the porn parody, Clitoris Cop
(?): Just awful
R: Keaton’s Crotch
M: Keaton’s Cock and Keaton’s Crotch. Two very different porn parodies
JK: Yeah, um, the one with all the gilfs is really off-putting
M: There’s a woman licking her own--her own crotch
R: In the old folks home?
M: In the old folks home, yeah
R: There’s probably some kind of old folks home porn out there somewhere
JH: No, Rich, I’ll tell you--I’m gonna say this on camera right now, I’ve had friends who have worked in old folks homes, they masturbate so much
[Mike and Jack snicker] M: Your friends that work at the old folks home? [Rich and Jack burst into laughter]
JH: The old folks
M: Ohh
JH: The old folks
M: I thought you were rattin’ out your friends
JH: Well, they might too, they might too, I’m not judging that, I’m not judging any of it. But old people are just like--they’re just--they’re just jackin’ and jillin all day long
M: So back to Keaton’s Crotch
JH: Alright, so, in Keaton’s Crotch, Lee Majors has a lot of paunch and is--is
R: Well, they don’t let us see his paunch
M: Lee Majors has a paunch-free contract
JK: That was one of my favorite parts of the movie, it was all the artful ways they hid Lee Majors’ paunch

[35:28] JH: I don’t really understand why this movie exists
R: We--we had speculated--because there’s a lot of old people in the film, it’s--it’s--it’s a way for people not to get kicked out of SAG, because it’s been too long since they’ve been in a motion picture
JH: It’s a yearly thing, you were saying?
JK: Yeah, well, there’s--they have a certain limitation, if you’re not in a movie for so long you get kicked out of the guild, and then you lose any benefits that you obtain and so, when you’re elderly, there’s not a lot of roles out there, so perhaps, they all pooled their resources and once a year, all the old folks make one movie that they can all act in [The Expendables poster shows up]
JH: Don’t get down on the olds, Jack, you’re gonna be one of them…
M: There’s roles for people of all ages, from…
JH: You’re gonna be old someday 
JK: No, I’ll be dead way before that [Takes a sip]
M: Die young and leave a great-looking corpse
R: Have you seen--
JH: (?) with children
R: Have you read our comments? I’m not gonna make it two more weeks [Mike does a hearty laugh]
JH: ‘Cause he got that diabeetus
R: Yeah, yeah
JK: That diabeetus
M: I say you have diabetes, and everyone believed it, so I’m gonna keep saying it
JH: Well, yeah, they think he has diabetes, they think you’re an alcoholic 
M: I don’t know why they would think that [Drinks]
[Everyone laughs, Mike picks up the bottle to refill his glass ] M: I mean, really, it’s weird
JH: I can’t believe that anyone would think that Mike is an alcoholic, I mean--
M: You gotta have a little alcohol
JH: Who are these people? Why would they--like why would that even be a thing?
[“I don’t know why they would think that” repeats over a loop of Mike refilling his glass]
M: Well, I’d--I’d like to address your point which was probably the best point of our Keaton’s Cop discussion, was what the fuck was the point of this movie? 

[38:28] [Guy shoots at a house and it blows up. The two main characters try to escape by car]
R: Oh my god???
J: That was that
R: What was the point of that scene?

[38:54] R: We had fun with the movie by coming up with all of Abe Vigoda’s weird, uh, stipulations for starring in the film
[In screening room] 
J: Abe, you have to remember to say words
JK: “I need another ice cream bar”
J: “You want words, it’s gonna cost you one ice cream bar.” Bribe him with ice cream
JK: “I want to go on the ferry, make a scene on the ferry” [At table] Abe Vigoda kept being in very weird situations that seemed to benefit Abe Vigoda 
R: Yeah, and not do anything for the film. “I want oysters. We need a scene where I eat oysters”
M: There’s the famous taxi scene, where Abe Vigoda has to get his hair cut, which is unrelated to the film. We think he’s gonna talk to a mafia informant, but really, he just needed his hair cut
JH: We wants to go around the block--
M: And Lee Majors is in the car, waiting, and Abe Vigoda gets his haircut, gets in a cab, and Lee Majors is like, oh fuuuuck
R: “I won’t be in your film unless I can get a haircut and take a short taxi ride”
M: And a taxi ride, and they go to this thing that looks like, like an ice cream stand? But somehow they have oysters
JH: Yeah--but then there’s also an ice cream bar
M: Yeah, ice cream and Abe Vigoda gets oysters and--oh, they park the car, Lee Majors gets out, he walks through the restaurant, comes outside, goes over and uses the payphone and Abe Vigoda comes through, he sits down and immediately a waitress comes up with oysters

[41:32] M: They always, always get the midwest right in films
JH: 100 percent
R: Have they ever made the mistake of mountains being in the background? Just out of curiosity….
JH: Probably
M: Uh, fucking Christmas Vacation, with Chevy Chase, and they’re all [???] license plate, we’re gonna go get a tree. There’s like, fucking Rocky mountains in the background

[42:51] [Rich gets up and leaves for seemingly no reason]
M: Rich is just--just leaving. All right, bye
JK: Bye, Rich
JH: I don’t know why--
M: He’s gonna take a dump in his Sony swagbag 

[44:07] R: This is actually a joy for me, because, for once, I actually understand what happened in the film
JK: I wanted to give you a little breather
R: Yeah, no, Space Raiders is about a band of like, filthy space criminals and they attack like, a little corporate space base to rob stuff and a little kid stows away aboard the ship they steal, and they go on an adventure with the kid, where they learn to like the kid and they gotta bring this kid back home and things keep happening, that keep them from getting the kid back home, and then everyone dies, like Rogue One, so I guess it’s the best movie that was ever fucking made

[44:51] R: Space prostitute lady looks a lot better than s--than uncanny valley Tarkin
M: Rich is throwing shade at Rogue One
JH: Ohh
M: Rich, do you know what throwing shade means?
R: What--what does that mean? In the hip--in the hip lingo, Mike. What does that mean? [Mike looks at the camera] That sounds nice, like if it’s a sunny day out...have some shade, oh thanks, dude! [Mike rubs his face](?)

[49:00] R: It’s--it’s not, though, like a direct 1-to-1 knockoff, like, we’re ripping off Aliens, and we’ve got an alien monster running around in a spaceship, it’s similar in like, the style of like, the props, there’s a grittiness to it that you’ve got in the Star Wars films, but storywise, it’s not like--you gotta--then they--Luke learns how to use the Fo--Duke learns how to use the Force, after--after Mobi Bon Pebobi teaches him the ways of the Judi

[50:16] R: This movie is rated very highly amongst pedophiles
[50:33] JK: You can cut away now! Please cut away now!
[50:39] M: Yeah, it was the bad touch, but, you know, child to man bad touch
[51:35] [Mike makes a confused face, trying to figure out where he’s heard the music before] *Less than 2 minutes into the film* M: Sounds like Star Trek 3 music

[54:35] [Josh makes a heart shape with his fingers]

[54:46] [Talking about Space Raiders] R: This is a fucking efficient film. It’s so efficient that I’m going to skip over Josh and nominate this as my pick for best of the worst.

[55:33] R: You have some major talent there, is the thing!
JH: And it’s just kind of fluffed off--
M: No pun intended
R: Ohhhhhhh. That was a six mill yen doylair comment
M: That was a seven million dollar fail

[56:13] M: Space Raiders, you go girl!
Rich and Jack: Yeah! [Them and Mike throw fists into the air, they freeze, Josh continues talking]
