oh my god
is that a zima
my apologies to our canadian friend colin
he loves the zima
this is the last one
it's been sitting in our fridge for three years
it's been expired since uh 2018
see what happens
good luck
how is it
it's gross
it's not as good as you remembered it
i think some of the carbonation has been lost
i think you missed what you were doing rich
it's okay
what
it's not as good as you remember it
oh you're talking about the trooper
okay
did you get a clean take of him saying that
yeah well speaking of not as good as you remember it we're here today
oh i'm not cutting out the part
we didn't get the joke
oh my god i wasn't you're going to do
that to someone who's not rich evans
i forgot what we watched today we
watched rat finka booboo
yeah i got two movies in front of me i
remember watching one so
already i'm confused
[Music]
should we point out that we're doing
this discussion as a last minute
thing before winter murders us all right
yes
this is a a hastily thrown together best
of the worst
because it's going to be too miserable
to go outside in wisconsin for the next
week and a half technically it's going
to be miserable to go
inside because the reason we're filming
this is because
our studio is going to be too [ __ ]
cold to film it
will be snowed in and it'll be too cold
to film back here
before before a string of 14 plus days
of one one digit temperatures
we're getting dumped on by snow so so we
decided to revisit an old favorite
and that went great
connie
welcome to another spotlight episode
we're talking about a movie that we
watched
close to 10 years ago i think it
predates best of the worst
uh it it helped coin a phrase that we
use on best of the worst
and we have not seen it in a decade so
we decided to revisit
blood shack aka the trooper it's it's
memorable to us because it was one of
the like the original
movie nights yeah at least it might have
been the first one i went to
uh so the trooper is a film
from 1970. there are there are roman
numerals that
that fly by and our quick read of the
newman
and our quick read of the newman
and our quick read of the roman numeral
mike i'm suing you for copyright
infringement
or the new the newman roman romules
uh we sound like someone that made the
trooper
we saw we saw mnl and three x's
and that's just to signify that at one
point it was supposed to be a porno the
three axes
this is a porno filmmaker his name is
ray dennis steckler he did a couple
legitimate movies is it for this is it
the same mattress
yeah that's why those stains are there
now
[Music]
oh look at she's sleeping right on the
mattress oh gross
why ugh why would you
not why would you just go in your
underwear well the movie told her to
you know why uh so as the lead actress
a porn actress and maybe the blonde was
i have no idea
i want to be in my next it's a real
movie does that mean i don't have to get
naked
well i'll meet you halfway
you'll be in your underwear how about
that oh but i gotta lay on that same
mattress
did you clean it from the last time
action
meet me halfway that was the last film i
was in
we're stalling we're stalling because we
don't want to talk about the trooper no
we can talk about the trooper let's talk
about the trooper
well first of all what is the plot of
the trooper take your time it's very
complicated so make sure you remember it
all i'm going to talk about it because
okay real quick this this like you said
this is 10
10 years back when we first started
really getting into the b movies
we were laughing we had a great time
then we realized that there is a whole
ocean
[Music]
of b-movies out there there is a
universe this is the port
that we set sail from
it's a beautiful metaphor rich and this
is the port we set sail from yes
and um we're going back this is the this
is the small town we grew up in we're
going back to
our stomping grounds we're going to go
home again and we go oh my god is that
you know is that the school i used to go
to
it's so small and awful gross is that
where i used to hang out on the weekends
that's the old mall
you know it looks like like a dump that
so this is us going back
to our roots our b movie roots which is
the trooper
oh no he's just right there
does he have a fencing sword it's like a
swashbuckling sword right
[Music]
are they just running in a circle it's
not a very big
[Music]
eat your heart out alfred hitchcock
but is it fun that's why we're here
today
it is it is our spotlight i know i feel
bad it's our spotlight because it was a
lot
more fun 10 years ago but that was
that was before some gems like miami
connection
yeah that was before neil breen
[ __ ] that was before len kabzinski for
our diamond cobra versus white fox
what what was that a video we did
i don't remember that one like if i were
to go to our channel and would i find
that video
i don't know did we do a video on that
but the oh the important thing that i
was trying to get to was that there are
uh strangely two versions there's a
longer and a shorter version uh the the
shorter version is like 42 minutes
the longer version i think is an hour
ten yeah
um and there's a couple of scenes in the
longer version
that seem important that have been cut
out of the cleaned up
shorter version it's kind of a mess yeah
the shorter
the shorter version is bloodshack the
longer version is called the trooper
yes the trooper is the original title uh
and and in that we see the original
title sequence and so it's like a bunch
of artwork
which is cool yeah yeah um so at some
point somebody said you shouldn't call
your film the chooper
no not the [ __ ] that sounds weird let's
[Music]
he kind of landed on the cop get your
gun you're not fast enough for the
jupiter
get up troopers
he stabs like one of those those little
birds
[Laughter]
okay so there's a there's there's this
150 year old
beat up shack in the middle of a
absolutely giant plot of dirt and
dead vegetation and everybody wants
this shack even though
people that go into the shack all are
mysteriously killed
by the supernatural entity known as the
trooper uh yeah people people are just
drawn
to this shack it's a legend it's a local
legend because teenagers show up
children show up look the kids are
curious everybody's curious about this
building
because it's famous for its hauntings
which is the trooper
like a group of teenagers there's two
guys and a girl and they're like we
don't want to stay here and she's like
i'm going to stay here myself just
abandon her in the middle of nowhere
i'm gonna i'm gonna prove the legend
wrong i'm gonna stay overnight in this
building
i dare that trooper to come get me i'm
gonna spend the night here
that's what you think that's right
mister
i heard about your ghosts and how it
kills people well i ain't a chicken not
like my friends i dare it to come get me
well maybe they're smart now maybe you
just better get out of here too
no way baby yes and so then she goes to
sleep overnight
on the filthy mattress originally she
takes out like a sleeping bag and she
puts it on top of the mattress and my
thought was
oh my god she's not gonna sleep on that
filthy mattress
and then the next shot she's taking off
all of her clothes
and she's lying down on the filthy
mattress
but but she is warned by an important
character in the film we haven't
mentioned daniel
he's the caretaker of the run-down
disgusting 150 year old shack
with the [ __ ] stained mattress he he
he's in charge of the upkeep of this
which explains a lot really i want to
fix up this place
picks up the ranch house tear down that
old water tower
it's about to fall down on somebody
anyway get rid of that old house
that's a historical monument it's been
there for over 150 years
[Laughter]
you know the only history that places
guys about 150 years history is definite
you know that
but the point is the back story is uh
the the owner
of the land the estate has passed away
about a year ago
right and daniel is the is the caretaker
the groundskeeper he
maintains the property by hanging out
and throwing beer bottles into
a garbage can also randomly shoveling
some shoveling uh the man he's
cultivating he's cultivating the dirt
you gotta keep keep it fresh he doesn't
like wearing a shirt
and he doesn't like uh warning people
about the trooper but by gum he has to
do it
over and over and over uh go ahead and
stay but if the trooper comes to get you
well you just deserve it trooper will
get you the chipper will get you
stay out of there the trooper will get
you i warned you
i told you um but we discovered
throughout the plot of the film that
there is a bit
of uh the hatfield mccoy kind of family
feud that goes back 150 years um
caroline were introduced to caroline she
is an actress
my uncle jim wrote some of the best
horror movies i ever acted in
yeah i saw a couple they're pretty good
special drill killer for those crazy man
got out you know
i'll start we don't know that in the
edit we watched
bloodshack she's not an actress she's
just a woman she's she's a niece
she's the niece of the guy who passed
away she occasionally comes by and tours
the property
stays for a couple of days has a whole
assortment of outfits
that she brings with to get dusty she
makes sure that dirt's getting shoveled
by daniel
yep and uh she tours the property
she gonna sit on the dirty mattress
everybody sits on the dirty mattress
i'm feeling this lady yeah yeah she put
her foot down
[Laughter]
she's got all these like like like high
fashion outfits
i'm not rubbing my naked ass on that
mattress
and her great-great-grandfather and this
guy named
tim something who wants to buy the
property his
great-great-grandfather those two
grandfathers had a poker game
where they were the what was up up for
the
the pot in the poker game was the deed
to this property
and it's it's speculated that um carol's
grandfather cheated during the poker
game which led to a showdown at noon
this is a lot of exposition how do we
know any of this
through extensive voiceover
while people are walking daniel told me
the reason tim
foster wanted the ranch so badly was
that he felt it belonged to him
you see back over a hundred years ago
they're half belonging to tim's great
grandfather jen and put up the ranches
as stakes
well my grandfather's day there they
were out in the streets of town
grandfather silas all the way to close
distance ever since daniel can remember
he said he'd leave the deck of cards
have been stacked against him who needs
scenes when he can just film people
walking and add voice over
let all this property rightfully belong
to the fosters
how do you convey information
tim foster was right though when he said
i owned a lot of good property
for one thing it was the biggest
[Music]
is this the worst possible way of
conveying expositional information
like not in terms of the filmmaking
because that saves them a whole lot of
time
so many scenes they just don't have to
shoot like an opening text crawl would
have been much better right
uh like a fantasy film yeah it's like
the opening of star wars
[Music]
i mean you could have a scene of of
discovery
or you have a scene that takes place in
like 1864.
how you start your film yeah yeah
flashback
your your bottom of the barrel of choice
is
filming people walking around while it's
a long lens you just
read the the plot do you think they
didn't have any plot when they shot the
movie he just filmed them and they're
like we'll figure it out later and add
voices
that's the worst case scenario the next
one is someone just
straight up telling her yeah well or
your grandfather did this at this
camera third is discovery
maybe she had no idea about the history
of the property goes to the library goes
to the library and then looks at a
newspaper wow
and the old librarian comes over oh i
know about the chupa property
or you know the james cameron method i'm
here to help you
i'm reece searching techcon bn38416
assigned to protect you
which uh terminator the the expository
dialogue like time travel this and that
it's just all just told during an
exciting action card chase
all right listen the terminator's an
infiltration unit
part man part machine underneath it's a
hyper alloy combat chassis
but outside it's living human tissue
flesh
skin hair blood grown for the cyborgs
i mean that well that's the the famous
that's the legend of blood shack and
that's where our phrase
in the early days the best of the worst
came from is that the movie was
notoriously short
because there's so little story to the
movie that
uh to pad out the running time they just
went to the rodeo
and shot a bunch of b-roll which led to
our expression
shooting the rodeo which is whenever you
see a movie where there's clearly
padding
just to stretch out the running time
where they just go to a parade or they
go to
some sort of public event to add uh
production value
to your film and pad out the running
time yeah it's not
specifically just padding it's it's
uh uh serendipitous padding
where it's like there happens to be a
rodeo happening
in this middle of nowhere dirt town
because they
they do have a scene where they go into
town and it is
something to be desired their town
in the meantime i called up mrs potts
and asked her if she would show me
around
who's mrs potts take the
who kids kids the neighbors
this is now their mother
[Laughter]
there's mrs potts is the mother okay we
haven't been introduced to her but
now we understand those are hurricanes
yeah you know they just took the cameras
out
mos no no audio equipment they they
try to tie it in a little bit because
like tim shows up
yeah and she's there but then they just
had voice over to explain what he's
talking to her about instead of us
seeing what he's talking about
the music is making oh no he's there tim
foster
i'd say the rodeo scenes in this add a
lot to the movie they break up the
amount of scenes where daniel tells
people
to not go into the shack or the trooper
will get them
it's like the perfect comedy run yeah
yeah and it's a flat angle
left to right this just needs the
scooby-doo gang
[Laughter]
he's great he is great every time he
shows up the movie just
just uh lights up he's the reason i like
this movie
ten years ago cause he just
he just awkwardly runs in for the side
of the camera with his knife held up
over his head
it's like that scene in the exorcist
three just like yeah they do it like
five times in this and they're lacking
any sort of style or pacing
to make the scene actually scary
he is wearing like an all black outfit
with just the face
it kind of resembles like a fencing
outfit without the mask he's never on
camera for very long i think his face is
always exposed
yeah right yeah and um he
his sword is like a i don't know
what kind of sword it is like a three
musketeer sword with the with the curved
uh
it's funky looking it's very funky it's
not necessarily
it kind of looks like a like a a fencing
sword but it's
it's not as pointy and thin it's not as
thin the blade's too fast but it's
certainly not
my point is it's not a scary weapon
it's a silly weapon it's not it's not
your classic butcher knife it's not a
butcher knife and it's not a machete
both of those fall under scary
and his outfit it looks like a cat
burglar outfit
mixed with a fencing outfit with with
the mustache so it kind of me it's like
a fencer
meets three musketeers in the desert
what would have been more appropriate
is like a a cowboy
a a potato sack over his head
yeah uh yeah a scarecrow potato sack
costume a
a dusty cowboy with like uh
yeah like a burlap sack face with just
the eye holes cut out
classic executioner's hood sure um
the was it the town that feared sundown
tell the dreaded sundown yeah
texas arcana yeah yeah uh something like
that that's
that's falls in theme with the 150 year
old building
yeah and not a not just a black jumpsuit
not just a black cat suit jump jumpsuit
uh fencing outfit with the three
musketeers sword you want to imply that
it's the vengeful ghost of the dead
great great grandfather right right
instead it's one of the
it turns out the shocking twist is it's
one of the only three characters in the
film
oh my god it's tim the guy who wants to
buy the land
that's not the trooper he's not 150
years old
that's tim foster he's just trying to
scare you off your ranch
don't let anybody ever tell you the
difference don't ever go in that old
house
or the trooper will get you
and the oscar goes to him
he's just trying to scare you off your
ranch don't let anybody ever tell you
the difference
don't ever go in that old house or the
trooper will get you
[Music]
[Applause]
but there is uh prior to tim a trooper
that existed before him that's the
question is the trooper that we see in
the movie before the big reveal that
it's tim at the end
is that supposed to be the real trooper
i and the only time it's tim is in that
final scene
i think this is just going back to
scooby-doo logic
there's uh there's always been an old
legend about the killer ghost in the
area
that never really existed well daniel at
the beginning
after he he disposes of the body of the
blonde girl
that stays overnight because he's he he
responds very nonchalantly like
oh he's used to this by now he's like oh
i gotta dump another body
no i warned you i told you the trooper
would get you
but you wouldn't listen no so where are
these other bodies coming from bad
filmmaking
or maybe maybe
maybe tim's just been trying this this
goofy uh
murder plot to run the people off the
land for like the last
15 years it just hasn't ever worked but
he's still trying
right around the time daniel got hired
yeah yeah
because yeah the first murder
potentially probably would have been
the blonde girl daniel probably should
have said oh my god
like oh call the police someone's been
murdered like i can't
i've always heard about the legends but
i've never experienced an actual killing
on our property
so were the legends real uh we're gonna
assume
tim picked up on the like you said the
scooby-doo effect picked up on the
history
decided to play it to his advantage to
get carol to sell him the property
because
he wanted it it had secret a secret
water reservoir
yeah that's thrown in a line of dialogue
something else i forgot what it was
it was water they didn't say there was
like a lake under under there yeah
or a river or something which maybe
meant that the land could be
fertile i don't know anything about
farming but well you live in like a
desert area any source of water is
useful yeah so maybe it was like if you
didn't know about the
the groundwater then you maybe didn't
bother trying to plant crops
yeah so maybe he knew but oil would have
been better yeah that would have been
more movie-like
more easily translatable i understand
how somebody can profit off of this
the layman needs thunder we don't know a
lot about farming
as as milwaukee and i'm sure it requires
more than digging dirt though
right but if the if there's an
oil deposit directly under the trooper
house
that makes sense to the layman as of
why someone would find that valuable
movie makes
lots of mistakes easily correctable
mistakes
easily correctable mistakes
[Music]
oh my god i warned you
[Music]
we often talk about with these movies a
lot of times they feel like the
filmmakers are like what do we have
and so they put whatever they have in
the movie to add to the production value
and then in the case of this movie
they're like what do we have we got a
shack
a blood shack we got a shack and we got
a
a sword that we found at an antique
store how do we make a movie around this
well my kid was a pirate for halloween
last year
and so we've got a plastic pirate sword
yeah
that's all they got and even that wasn't
enough
to make it feature length all these
things so they had to stretch it out
with
shots of puppies and cowboys let's go to
the rodeo
four times during the film daniel had to
walk around
that shot where caroline is walking up
to the house
oh yeah in her inner uh her uh flag
pants
i think you need to do a side by side of
the
the pan shot of the golden gate bridge
from the room
and see which one which one wins which
one's longer
one is meant to stretch the running time
one is
pure incompetence yeah which one's which
jay
yes correct answer
[Music]
do
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
daniel
like there's no noises it's just weird
there's like a shadow they're going to
add those later rich they haven't gotten
around to it yet
what you do if you want to build tension
is you have a blonde girl sit on a
filthy mattress and react to sound
effects that we as the audience don't
hear
okay see we know there's tension because
daniel keeps running in and
says you gotta stay out of that house
the trooper will get you yeah
and he keeps doing that tension is is
lingering on a shot for a very long time
as a character in american flag pants
walks across the desert
it goes on for a long time that means
it's building tension will this shot
ever end
i don't know that is
tension hitchcock always said tension is
uh when there's a bomb under the table
and the audience knows it's there but
the characters don't but ray dennis
teckler has taught us that tension is
when nothing happens
[Laughter]
who is the horror master
[Laughter]
we do get a similar scene to psycho the
post shower scene in psycho where norman
bates has to
to clean up after mother and uh and put
the body in the back of his car
you know what jay i think everyone in
this film needed a shower scene because
there were some dirty people
it was was was daniel and
you've seen the faces of the little
girls do they have parents
do you remember the fight scene yes
see this is all they do on the ranch
they shovel that's all you can do
dirt i'm sorry
god it's getting violent jesus christ
wow
[Music]
oh come on stop it
when the little girls are just playing
with a shovel we keep cutting the little
girls i'm like why are we
cutting the little girls playing with a
shovel and then and then it's revealed
that the little girls are standing right
next to this violent
fight between two grown men it's like
that comedy shot and
i don't know if it's in one of the naked
gun movies or if it was on police squad
where we cut back and forth between
driving shooting and then the bad guy
shooting and then we cut to the wide
shot and they're right next to each
other
and then we assume because we've seen
movies before that the little girls
were going to dig up one of the bodies
that daniel has been hiding
because he's covering up for the trooper
for no good reason why is daniel
covering up with the trooper we never
really know
i guess he's just concerned about the
the legacy of this property and he
doesn't want it to be sullied
he's a damn good caretaker that's why
but but that fight scene that was that
was poised
for some classic alfred hitchcock
tension
with those two fighting one of them is
the killer
right and you see like where the girls
are playing with the shovel you see like
kind of freshly buried lumps
boom boom every now and then the camera
is panning
with their looking over their shoulder
and the camera kind of moves a little
bit
and then finally they're just playing
around and one of the third freshly
covered up holes and then they have to
speed up the fight he's desperately
trying to knock out
tim before they get to that point and
then finally the girls do
and then that first girl's hand kind of
comes out but nobody notices it and you
know
something like that in fact in fact
tim's hat during the fight gets knocked
off and falls like on like where the
hand has been revealed
right hey there you go that's a running
theme in this movie is
hats falling off
[Music]
can we talk about the famous hat falling
off scene
daniel's on the porch and his hat falls
off
and it was the most exciting thing to
happen in the film that's okay
trooper you keep knocking them off i'll
keep bearing them
they're not gonna tear this whole house
down i gotta find the bodies first
they'll never find the parties where i
put them what the hell
but they'll never knock this whole house
down he's talking to the trooper
[Music]
but his head fell off in the take and
they just left it
he's he's talking to the trooper people
who's that blows off and then he's like
looks at the camera you see a hand like
a blurry hand
like this just in the corner of the
frame
and then he keeps talking is that also
flies off when him and uh carol are
walking
yeah they're saving film
they don't you know that's a they're
saving money
hats off to the director
so tumbleweed
i think you know what i would say even
though this isn't the most exciting bee
movie in the world
i think if you're this type of person
that saw star wars and i was like oh
this was influenced by
flash gordon shorts so you went back and
you watched those flash gorn shorts
knowing that they're not as good as star
wars
you know hey i've seen you know miami
connection i've seen all these b movies
i should go back and see blood shack
yeah
i and i would say i have seen
duller worse movies on best of the worst
yes we usually destroy them
but this one has a special place though
i know yeah there is lots of
lots of baffling stuff in this uh
the repetition of the dialogue is funny
yeah it kind of wears on you where he's
just constantly telling people to watch
out for the trooper
the word the trooper which is a
nonsensical word to begin with loses all
meaning about 15 minutes into the film
yes
it's never quite explained and then the
the
the desperate attempts to save the movie
by adding voice over
is funny the chooper attack scenes are
comical
um there's just a lot of good stuff in
it and it doesn't it doesn't wear out
its welcome
it it well that's for sure it ended
sooner than we were expecting
yeah i don't know what i'm going to do
i think i'll just worry about it
tomorrow
i'll just worry about it tomorrow
uh was she there was just a murder
and they call the cops an attempted
murder yeah oh we're done
[Laughter]
i thought it was 70 minutes it's not
even 60 minutes and it's just like all
those
like movie beats that needed to be there
like the big
ending you know where there's like a big
like i said the
the the rodeo people coming to the ranch
at the end and throwing a big party
and then the trooper comes out and and
has like
kills multiple people in this big epic
ending that none of that happens it's so
low budget and so restricted but it
still
holds up in terms of watching a
relatively short b movie
that's kind of bizarrely fascinating to
watch it has that you kind of have to
look at it from the lens of like the
story behind
the movie where you're looking at it
from the perspective of the filmmaking
and what was going on behind the scenes
that
that adds a bit to it if you're just
watching it as a b movie yeah it's not
hilarious or anything well maybe we'll
take a little break from ray dennis
steckler and uh
maybe watch another film by a
notoriously bad filmmaker
well let me let me know when we're gonna
do that get me uppity up to date
i will rich okay
[Music]
stay away from this house now that was
your mother on the phone she was at home
now
come on get going if you want to play
around here anymore stay away from this
house
