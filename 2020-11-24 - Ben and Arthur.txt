to ben and arthur
rip ben
rip arthur
rip arthur's brother
rip john william's priest
rip lawyer
lawyer's assistant
yeah
we never even see the lawyer
that's just the lawyer's secretary
oh, geez
sorry
they mention that in one line of dialogue
"our attorney's secretary"
"someone killed her"
oh, my god
rip 90 minutes of our life
"more drastic measures"
"definitely more drastic measures for these two idiots"
"definitely"
this is ben & arthur
uh
one of our favorite, go-to movies to watch on b-movie night, behind the scenes
"who was that"
"that was mildred"
"she said somebody broke into their garage"
"we should go down and check our things"
bye
my diamonds
my cd wallet
it's got chumbawamba
i think we've watched this movie probably five or six times now in the last year or two
yeah
rich, would you like to tell us
you, you do the, all the mail
yeah, we do the mail, and, you know, sometimes, sometimes you see repeats of things
and ben & arthur was coming up a few times
yeah
it's coming up, you get, like, multiple copies of something
maybe, maybe there's something to it
you put it in
you check it out
what do we got
what do we got
hot many, how many copies do you think, of ben & arthur were sent to our studio
18 million copies
oh, my god
that's almost as many as mean guns, starring ice-t
that we keep getting copies of for some reason
so, rich
i guess rich
tell us all about ben & arthur
ben & arthur is a story written by an angry, frustrated, gay man
"aw, fuck it"
"another two years, ben"
"this is ignorance, and completely unfair"
"this country fucking sucks"
"it just fucking sucks"
i think i understand where sam mraovich is coming from
"fucking sucks, ben"
"hey, would you relax"
like, he's growing up, and his parents are probably, like, he's just going through a phase
"you're just confused right now"
"i'm not confused"
or, you know, the church doesn't like this
"are you still haunted by these demons"
"what's that"
"i mean, are you still a homosexual, is what i mean"
"those demons"
and he, he's growing up in a world where he can't be himself
and he just spewed it out into this script
yeah
it comes, it's similar to, like, the room
like, tommy wiseau
that came from a very pure place where he thought everyone betray him
"it's over"
"it's not over"
"everybody betray me"
"i'm fed up with this world"
like, he, he really, that was a serious attempt at a drama, about, uh, uh, how about people are mean to him
but in the case of this, yeah, you can tell that the writer/director/star, uh, is very upset about a lot of, the way he's been treated
he's angry at the world
and he's angry about a lot of things that relate to him, his lifestyle, and not being able to be himself
being persecuted
i get it
which is fair and understandable
unfortunately, he made one of the worst movies of all time
just because you have strong feelings about something, maybe, maybe you shouldn't vomit them up and just throw them at the world if you have no talent
"you fuck"
the character is messy
very messy
it was meticulously decorated by the set
oh
the set designer
oh
it was supposed to look like that
i see
it represents the state of his mind
rich is a true film critic
what does the actual script behind his head represent
sam mraovich, the writer/director/star, plays arthur, and his, uh, his, uh, love interest in the film, the one he that wants to marry
super hot model dude
yeah
it's clear when you look at him, you're like, okay, that one's the writer/director, that other guy's a hired talent
it's pretty clear which is which
so what's the story of the movie itself
uh, lots of persecution
that's basically
lots of people angry about sam and arthur's love
that's basically it
yes
it's, it's, it's a, it's a gay drama, right
yeah
and, um, this, real quick, this film was released by cqc, cultural q connections
i looked it up
they do a lot of lgbtq films
it's, everything
a lot of david decouteau movies
no, no, no
it seems to be a little more, less crass and sleazy than that
a little, a little classier
more like
movies about real issues, probably
okay
more, moreso, like, a david decouteau movies is just
it's the gay equivalent of our sexual exploitation movies
the gay equivalent of shark exorcist
but this, this, this company, i just browsed it real quick, and they have a ton of titles, and they picked this movie up for distribution
probably one of their earliest films
we found an interview with the director
his brother, chris mraovich
oh, is that his actual brother
they have the same last names
they could, i guess they could be husbands
but it says editing, chris mraovich and sam mraovich
mm
um, so he's only, this chris character is only credited as the editor
i hope that's not his real brother, because that final scene of this movie would be incredibly awkward to watch with your real brother
no, no, no, no, no
he just did the editing
maybe, maybe sam edited the nudie scene
and if it's his husband, it would be incredibly awkward that he hired the model to play his husband
that's true
that's why the sex scenes were so awkward
no, honey
you're playing my brother
i'm gonna be doing the makeout scenes with this guy
what a hunk
"what a hunk"
hey, they gotta sell the movie somehow
look at the cover, and sam is not on it
in fact, there's quite a discrepancy on the size of the photos on the back
yeah
but we did find an interview with him from buzzfeed
yeah
where they said this is the worst gay movie of all time
the worst movie of all time, the room
but they said this is the worst gay movie of all time
"i resent that"
"you care more about some men, jesus, that you've never even"
oh, there's the camera in the reflection
he has the viewfinder flipped around so they could see the shot cuz there's no one behind it
a mistake
he had a little money to invest in a movie
he wanted to make a movie
he did
he wasn't quite experienced in filmmaking
clearly
you'd never guess
"oh, what are you gonna do about it"
oh, no
the table with the new year's eve party hat on it fell over
and it has all the hallmarks of a terrible, low-budget movie
all the, all the, the classic, classic traps one falls into when making a low-budget movie
but, but not like the, the power fantasy of the typical vanity project
this isn't the i am, i am the toughest, most sexy man
no, no
this is, yeah
this is somebody who feels like, uh, they've been, uh, oppressed and treated unfairly
he's a victim
i am the most persecuted man, is what this is
sure
and that comes from a real place
and, you know
with a twist of revenge
yeah
with a twist
well, that's the weird thing
the movie starts, and it's like, uh, and this is 2002, so it was a different time
but he's talking about, they turn on the radio
and it's definitely the real radio broadcast that says gay marriage is now legal in hawaii
"today's latest news"
"it's been a long battle here in hawaii"
"the public has long awaited the final decision of the court of hawaii"
"and the court has voted yes"
"homosexuals do have the right to get married"
"judge kevin james's ruling has made history in this country"
so they're, like, we're going to hawaii
they book the trip
"let's go to hawaii"
"let's go"
"let's go"
the tickets are non-refundable
"they're non-refundable"
and then the next day, the newspaper tells them, never mind
and so they, say, well, i guess there's no reason to go to hawaii now with our non-refundable tickets
so we're just not gonna go
we're just gonna eat that cost
"they're non-refundable"
we can never get married now
we'd have to go to vermont
"i don't see why we can't go see an attorney here in california, and get married here"
"why do we have to go all the way to vermont"
yeah
that's what they mentioned, is vermont
it's, you can get married in vermont
but that never came up before
they were, like, talking about hawaii as if it's, like, this is our first opportunity to get married
"so we go to vermont to get our civil union license, and if the state rejects to recognize it, then we go to the u.s. supreme court"
"that's right"
and, this, there's many questions
there's a lot of questions
there's more questions than partners
first, we thought his brother was the, the, uh, arthur
oh, yeah
cuz you see their names in the credits
ben
oh
we're just gonna keep fucking that up
no, no
see
i have, i have a system
ready
okay
ben
right
yeah
b for bald
as in, not bald
okay
b for bald as in 
not bald
not bald
so
bald
as in balding
yeah
like
sam
aka arthur
a
is the one that's balding
b
you've lost me
reverse it
reverse it
it would be so much easier
i give up
sam
sam is the main character
he's a
a comes before b
oh
who's ben
yes
and also, when you think of b, if, if, if, it would be so much easier if the balding one was named ben, right
ben is bald
yes
b, b
then flip it
ben is not the one that's balding
okay
that's so simple and elegant, mike
ben
ben is the
you've just gotta invert it in your head
ben is the one with the glorious head of hair
arthur is the one who has alopecia
right
okay
got it
ben
ben
all right
the one who is not bald is ben because he's not bald
yes, yes
the one who has alopecia is arthur because he actually has alopecia
yes
or he needs a toupee
for a
listen, i gotta system
okay
sam plays arthur, right
okay
and then
so he has some money to invest in this film
yeah
originally, we thought ben was his actual brother
and then we thought, oh
yes
cuz then we saw both their names in the credits
yes
or something
two mraoviches
yes
exactly
and then we thought, that's why the sex scenes are so uncomfortable
yeah
then we realized that ben is probably
he's not an actor
we looked him up
he has, has one role, and that's his one role
either he's a friend, or he was, he was
these, these are, like, modeling photos
yeah
that's, that has nothing to do with the movie, that cover
that looks like the cover of some sort of magazine, or something
it's, it's his, um, it's, it could be like his professional
headshots are for actors, like, body shots
yeah
i don't know what you call 'em
whatever
promotional shots for like a model
right
cuz this is his only film credit
this is his only film credit
so, um, sam mraovich probably paid, um, uh, like a model
and he's not a bad actor
"well, if it bothered you so much, and you felt so strongly about it, why didn't you say something then"
he's not, i mean, in context
mike is right
mike is right
compared to everyone else
compared to everyone else in this movie, okay
there's that scene where he's arguing with his, uh, wife, you know, and, and, he's not bad
"what's his name"
"not that it matters to you, but, his name's arthur, and we're gonna get married"
uh, sam is terrible
"what"
"hey, john, how's it going"
"yeah, ben, i, i just can't stand working here anymore, you know"
"this, this place is just driving me up the wall"
"so quit if you don't like it"
"find another job"
"yeah, i should"
"you know, i, i just can't stand it here anymore"
"the boss is bitchy, the customer's are cranky, and the hours suck"
"you know, and, you know"
everyone else is terrible
sam, what i said is, sam mraovich, he looks like he's angry, he looks like he's annoyed to have to act in the movie
"i told him to get his stupid wife over soon and get the divorce papers signed"
like, maybe he didn't want to act
maybe he just wanted to write and direct, but he knew that he couldn't get anybody else, so he's in the movie
"well, probably because you're some crazy psychotic fuck"
this makes perfect sense to me, though
because, when you make a movie, before you make the movie, it sounds like a terribly fun idea
that's, yes
hey, i've got all these crazy ideas
wouldn't it be fun if we made a movie
and then you start making the movie
yeah
"here's my list of deman--"
"here's my list of deman--"
"here's my list of deman--"
"oh, god"
it is not fun to make a movie
"filming"
"i hate myself"
but then there's other actors in the film that are probably, like, bottom-tier, l.a.-casting
cuz it, it, the article that we read on buzzfeed, there's an interview with the director on buzzfeed
they, he talks about the movie
he's, he's, he's not ashamed of it
he's like, eh, you know, it is what it is
yeah
i did my best
it's good to have a sense of humor about this
you can talk about the technical flaws of a bad movie, right
like, it's your first movie
like, eh, i don't know about, like, uh, recording, um, ambient sound, or, or tone, as they say
