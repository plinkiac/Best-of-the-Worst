to ben and arthur
rip ben
rip arthur
rip arthur's brother
rip john william's priest
rip lawyer
lawyer's assistant
yeah
we never even see the lawyer
that's just the lawyer's secretary
oh, geez
sorry
they mention that in one line of dialogue
"our attorney's secretary"
"someone killed her"
oh, my god
rip 90 minutes of our life
"more drastic measures"
"definitely more drastic measures for these two idiots"
"definitely"
this is ben & arthur
uh
one of our favorite, go-to movies to watch on b-movie night, behind the scenes
"who was that"
"that was mildred"
"she said somebody broke into their garage"
"we should go down and check our things"
bye
my diamonds
my cd wallet
it's got chumbawamba
i think we've watched this movie probably five or six times now in the last year or two
yeah
rich, would you like to tell us
you, you do the, all the mail
yeah, we do the mail, and, you know, sometimes, sometimes you see repeats of things
and ben & arthur was coming up a few times
yeah
it's coming up, you get, like, multiple copies of something
maybe, maybe there's something to it
you put it in
you check it out
what do we got
what do we got
hot many, how many copies do you think, of ben & arthur were sent to our studio
18 million copies
oh, my god
that's almost as many as mean guns, starring ice-t
that we keep getting copies of for some reason
so, rich
i guess rich
tell us all about ben & arthur
ben & arthur is a story written by an angry, frustrated, gay man
"aw, fuck it"
"another two years, ben"
"this is ignorance, and completely unfair"
"this country fucking sucks"
"it just fucking sucks"
i think i understand where sam mraovich is coming from
"fucking sucks, ben"
"hey, would you relax"
like, he's growing up, and his parents are probably, like, he's just going through a phase
"you're just confused right now"
"i'm not confused"
or, you know, the church doesn't like this
"are you still haunted by these demons"
"what's that"
"i mean, are you still a homosexual, is what i mean"
"those demons"
and he, he's growing up in a world where he can't be himself
and he just spewed it out into this script
yeah
it comes, it's similar to, like, the room
like, tommy wiseau
that came from a very pure place where he thought everyone betray him
"it's over"
"it's not over"
"everybody betray me"
"i'm fed up with this world"
like, he, he really, that was a serious attempt at a drama, about, uh, uh, how about people are mean to him
but in the case of this, yeah, you can tell that the writer/director/star, uh, is very upset about a lot of, the way he's been treated
he's angry at the world
and he's angry about a lot of things that relate to him, his lifestyle, and not being able to be himself
being persecuted
i get it
which is fair and understandable
unfortunately, he made one of the worst movies of all time
just because you have strong feelings about something, maybe, maybe you shouldn't vomit them up and just throw them at the world if you have no talent
"you fuck"
the character is messy
very messy
it was meticulously decorated by the set
oh
the set designer
oh
it was supposed to look like that
i see
it represents the state of his mind
rich is a true film critic
what does the actual script behind his head represent
sam mraovich, the writer/director/star, plays arthur, and his, uh, his, uh, love interest in the film, the one he that wants to marry
super hot model dude
yeah
it's clear when you look at him, you're like, okay, that one's the writer/director, that other guy's a hired talent
it's pretty clear which is which
so what's the story of the movie itself
uh, lots of persecution
that's basically
lots of people angry about sam and arthur's love
that's basically it
yes
it's, it's, it's a, it's a gay drama, right
yeah
and, um, this, real quick, this film was released by cqc, cultural q connections
i looked it up
they do a lot of lgbtq films
it's, everything
a lot of david decouteau movies
no, no, no
it seems to be a little more, less crass and sleazy than that
a little, a little classier
more like
movies about real issues, probably
okay
more, moreso, like, a david decouteau movies is just
it's the gay equivalent of our sexual exploitation movies
the gay equivalent of shark exorcist
but this, this, this company, i just browsed it real quick, and they have a ton of titles, and they picked this movie up for distribution
probably one of their earliest films
we found an interview with the director
his brother, chris mraovich
oh, is that his actual brother
they have the same last names
they could, i guess they could be husbands
but it says editing, chris mraovich and sam mraovich
mm
um, so he's only, this chris character is only credited as the editor
i hope that's not his real brother, because that final scene of this movie would be incredibly awkward to watch with your real brother
no, no, no, no, no
he just did the editing
maybe, maybe sam edited the nudie scene
and if it's his husband, it would be incredibly awkward that he hired the model to play his husband
that's true
that's why the sex scenes were so awkward
no, honey
you're playing my brother
i'm gonna be doing the makeout scenes with this guy
what a hunk
"what a hunk"
hey, they gotta sell the movie somehow
look at the cover, and sam is not on it
in fact, there's quite a discrepancy on the size of the photos on the back
yeah
but we did find an interview with him from buzzfeed
yeah
where they said this is the worst gay movie of all time
the worst movie of all time, the room
but they said this is the worst gay movie of all time
"i resent that"
"you care more about some men, jesus, that you've never even"
oh, there's the camera in the reflection
he has the viewfinder flipped around so they could see the shot cuz there's no one behind it
a mistake
he had a little money to invest in a movie
he wanted to make a movie
he did
he wasn't quite experienced in filmmaking
clearly
you'd never guess
"oh, what are you gonna do about it"
oh, no
the table with the new year's eve party hat on it fell over
and it has all the hallmarks of a terrible, low-budget movie
all the, all the, the classic, classic traps one falls into when making a low-budget movie
but, but not like the, the power fantasy of the typical vanity project
this isn't the i am, i am the toughest, most sexy man
no, no
this is, yeah
this is somebody who feels like, uh, they've been, uh, oppressed and treated unfairly
he's a victim
i am the most persecuted man, is what this is
sure
and that comes from a real place
and, you know
with a twist of revenge
yeah
with a twist
well, that's the weird thing
the movie starts, and it's like, uh, and this is 2002, so it was a different time
but he's talking about, they turn on the radio
and it's definitely the real radio broadcast that says gay marriage is now legal in hawaii
"today's latest news"
"it's been a long battle here in hawaii"
"the public has long awaited the final decision of the court of hawaii"
"and the court has voted yes"
"homosexuals do have the right to get married"
"judge kevin james's ruling has made history in this country"
so they're, like, we're going to hawaii
they book the trip
"let's go to hawaii"
"let's go"
"let's go"
the tickets are non-refundable
"they're non-refundable"
and then the next day, the newspaper tells them, never mind
and so they, say, well, i guess there's no reason to go to hawaii now with our non-refundable tickets
so we're just not gonna go
we're just gonna eat that cost
"they're non-refundable"
we can never get married now
we'd have to go to vermont
"i don't see why we can't go see an attorney here in california, and get married here"
"why do we have to go all the way to vermont"
yeah
that's what they mentioned, is vermont
it's, you can get married in vermont
but that never came up before
they were, like, talking about hawaii as if it's, like, this is our first opportunity to get married
"so we go to vermont to get our civil union license, and if the state rejects to recognize it, then we go to the u.s. supreme court"
"that's right"
and, this, there's many questions
there's a lot of questions
there's more questions than partners
first, we thought his brother was the, the, uh, arthur
oh, yeah
cuz you see their names in the credits
ben
oh
we're just gonna keep fucking that up
no, no
see
i have, i have a system
ready
okay
ben
right
yeah
b for bald
as in, not bald
okay
b for bald as in 
not bald
not bald
so
bald
as in balding
yeah
like
sam
aka arthur
a
is the one that's balding
b
you've lost me
reverse it
reverse it
it would be so much easier
i give up
sam
sam is the main character
he's a
a comes before b
oh
who's ben
yes
and also, when you think of b, if, if, if, it would be so much easier if the balding one was named ben, right
ben is bald
yes
b, b
then flip it
ben is not the one that's balding
okay
that's so simple and elegant, mike
ben
ben is the
you've just gotta invert it in your head
ben is the one with the glorious head of hair
arthur is the one who has alopecia
right
okay
got it
ben
ben
all right
the one who is not bald is ben because he's not bald
yes, yes
the one who has alopecia is arthur because he actually has alopecia
yes
or he needs a toupee
for a
listen, i gotta system
okay
sam plays arthur, right
okay
and then
so he has some money to invest in this film
yeah
originally, we thought ben was his actual brother
and then we thought, oh
yes
cuz then we saw both their names in the credits
yes
or something
two mraoviches
yes
exactly
and then we thought, that's why the sex scenes are so uncomfortable
yeah
then we realized that ben is probably
he's not an actor
we looked him up
he has, has one role, and that's his one role
either he's a friend, or he was, he was
these, these are, like, modeling photos
yeah
that's, that has nothing to do with the movie, that cover
that looks like the cover of some sort of magazine, or something
it's, it's his, um, it's, it could be like his professional
headshots are for actors, like, body shots
yeah
i don't know what you call 'em
whatever
promotional shots for like a model
right
cuz this is his only film credit
this is his only film credit
so, um, sam mraovich probably paid, um, uh, like a model
and he's not a bad actor
"well, if it bothered you so much, and you felt so strongly about it, why didn't you say something then"
he's not, i mean, in context
mike is right
mike is right
compared to everyone else
compared to everyone else in this movie, okay
there's that scene where he's arguing with his, uh, wife, you know, and, and, he's not bad
"what's his name"
"not that it matters to you, but, his name's arthur, and we're gonna get married"
uh, sam is terrible
"what"
"hey, john, how's it going"
"yeah, ben, i, i just can't stand working here anymore, you know"
"this, this place is just driving me up the wall"
"so quit if you don't like it"
"find another job"
"yeah, i should"
"you know, i, i just can't stand it here anymore"
"the boss is bitchy, the customer's are cranky, and the hours suck"
"you know, and, you know"
everyone else is terrible
sam, what i said is, sam mraovich, he looks like he's angry, he looks like he's annoyed to have to act in the movie
"i told him to get his stupid wife over soon and get the divorce papers signed"
like, maybe he didn't want to act
maybe he just wanted to write and direct, but he knew that he couldn't get anybody else, so he's in the movie
"well, probably because you're some crazy psychotic fuck"
this makes perfect sense to me, though
because, when you make a movie, before you make the movie, it sounds like a terribly fun idea
that's, yes
hey, i've got all these crazy ideas
wouldn't it be fun if we made a movie
and then you start making the movie
yeah
"here's my list of deman--"
"here's my list of deman--"
"here's my list of deman--"
"oh, god"
it is not fun to make a movie
"filming"
"i hate myself"
but then there's other actors in the film that are probably, like, bottom-tier, l.a.-casting
cuz it, it, the article that we read on buzzfeed, there's an interview with the director on buzzfeed
they, he talks about the movie
he's, he's, he's not ashamed of it
he's like, eh, you know, it is what it is
yeah
i did my best
it's good to have a sense of humor about this
you can talk about the technical flaws of a bad movie, right
like, it's your first movie
like, eh, i don't know about, like, uh, recording, um, ambient sound, or, or tone, as they say
we lost all sound
"isn't this great ben"
to to fill a scene so that there isn't a shot with just dead sound, right
you need tone to cover a background
to blend all your edits together
there's certain basics of editing, making a movie, right
maybe use a microphone
"we'll take care of all that shit when we get back to california"
"let's just enjoy it"
"enjoy"
"we have three more days here"
"and we have dinner plans tonight"
"okay"
"all right"
you can't even see the fountain
why film it here
a microphone is good
maybe, maybe don't use cardboard as your church set
yeah, yeah
maybe
there's that
there's a whole, there's all the all the classic pitfalls of making a low-budget movie are in this
and that's what makes it fun
mm-hmm
"yeah, this is great"
"this is really relaxing"
"hello"
so sam has some money
he, he gets some actors involved in this project
there's the detective guy
the l.a.p.d. detective guy who looks like a guy you'd hire for like detective 4
yeah
in like csi
oh, yeah
this, this entire, this movie is super l.a.
yes
in terms of all the, all the, uh, side characters, where you're like that guy works in a restaurant, that guy works at starbucks
and you're just, like, you know all these people have their day jobs
"yes"
and this is them trying to get into acting
for the most part, they're, they show up as extras
yeah
and then they put that on their resume
mm-hmm
you know you look them up on imdb, and they're in like bad boys three as, like, bar patron, uh, uncredited
or, or student film
yeah
this or that
like, there's the the priest who looks like, uh, john williams
well, that actually was john williams
i looked it up
oh
that's really john williams
yeah
he's trying to break into acting
yeah
i mean, he's done lots of great scores
but when you're trying to get into acting it's all about who you know
he doesn't have any he doesn't have any actor friends to work off of
everyone he knows is a director
yeah
exactly
he doesn't know anybody in the industry
john williams
no, no
his friend stephen didn't answer the phone that weekend
oh, god
he wanted to shoot a film
the phone rang, and stephen's like, oh, no john wants to act
i can't, we're not taking any calls from john for the next month
"well, the congregation is concerned that your mother's homosexuality may rub off on their children and send their souls straight to hell"
anyways, so
the cast is set
"you, know arthur we have ways to cure that for you"
"um, if you just join us for bible study five days a week, we could, uh, take care of that for you and cleanse that sinfulness of yours"
the stage is set
you forgot, you forgot the most important cast member
and, and that's, that's sam's apartment
"arthur, my bike is gone"
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
it goes through a lot of changes throughout the course of the film
it is probably the most, the thing that just stands out, out at you most in this movie
is that that shitty ass apartment with, like, folding tables for a desk
yeah
no furniture
no furniture
there's fucking just garbage all, over all over the place
there's a fucking mattress that's just propped up against the wall, because you know it's l.a.
and shit's expensive
and like seven actors, seven actors live there
yeah
well, in one scene there's a bed
in another scene, there's an air mattress
oh he got a futon
he got rid of oh oh he's dead back to
life
it's a miracle during that episode of
the timescape episode from star trek the
next generation
uh in one scene there's a halloween
decoration and then we fade out and fade
back into later that day the halloween
decoration is
gone oh he's back oh someone took down
the halloween decorations while he was
gone
and there's some christmas decorations
yeah there's depressing
wall art apartment
art as we learned depressing
suppressing our departments thanks
rich yeah oh oh god okay so
this is like if if you were
in your 20s right
you're struggling i mean it's not a it's
a decent sized apartment for ella it is
the the the the master bedroom ensuite
is
is quite large sure there's a bedroom
then there's this little like
like carpeted hallway part within the
ensuite and then there's the bathroom
in reality there's two actors that live
in that hallway
one lives in the bathroom you're
thinking of new york city
struggling actors in l.a are you kidding
me they all live in there
yeah so if if you remember that time of
your life
when you're in your early 20s and you
moved to a bigger city and you had zero
dollars
and you tried the best apartment you
could possibly get
for your five hundred dollars a month in
the
slummiest area in the nastiest apartment
and the worst furnishings you could
think of like a cheap coffee maker
you have your computer on a folding
table there's no room the printer is
jammed next to it
the tv is just on the ground the tv's on
the ground
at some point though they upgrade to a
nice burgundy tablecloth for the
computer
it goes from no tablecloth to a white
tablecloth to the the fancy burgundy
tablecloth
the martha stewart burkety computer
tablecloth
there's more character development for
this apartment than there is for ben and
arthur
oh look at all that garbage clean up
maybe he's moving out
the apartment has so many character arts
it's constantly
it's what they call a dynamic character
oh look at that this is some smoke put a
little smoke bomb on the gun
see the spark coming out of it yep then
there's
uh ben arthur which one know who cooks
ben
isn't ball ben is bob and ben isn't bald
so he's not arthur who
is bald okay so then you have arthur's
brother
who has an even worse apartment even
though he's supposed to be like
rich arthur goes to him for money
for their marriage license well first
for his marriage license and then
because he wants to go back to college
i need two thousand dollars for my
tuition to college
that that plot that was just dropped
yeah when he wanted to go back to school
business school you have to go to
business school
to open up porn shops that's another
venture that happens later in the film
remember ben and arthur talk about what
their plans for the future are
after they decide to get married yeah
i'm thinking about
getting a degree in business really yep
i'm thinking about opening up my own
little porno shop
no [ __ ] well that's cool if that's what
you want to do
it's good to have some goals are they
just meeting now
is this a flashback they don't know
anything about each other apparently
uh but then yeah cuts to uh ben
b not bald is
is washing dishes in the back of a
coffee shop
he's washing those dishes well first
he's waiting for someone to say action
and then he starts to wash the dishes
because that's why we have editing i
mean don't have that event
action
action action
action
then yeah he says well you know i have a
advanced degree in nursing
you have a degree in nursing you know
what the heck are you doing here
i got my music that's what i want to do
it's you know
i like this job but i'd rather he wants
to be a musician and that's never
brought up again and that's what that's
what holds them back
and it never comes up again no i didn't
i forgot he was he never played
he should play like a love song on his
guitar and they should have a little
scene where we get his
the the scope of his talents as a
musician never happens
they oh they discover that vermont has
legalized gay marriage off camera this
happens
yes they're just like oh hawaii didn't
work out let's go to vermont apparently
they've already
been whatever happened did they did they
not get a refund on those airline
tickets
they were unrefundable but ben we just
bought the tickets
they're non-refundable they just wasted
that hawaiian vacation they could go to
hawaii and just not get married but
still have a nice vacation in hawaii but
they just don't go
so what are we going to do i mean that
could have paid for his seventh of the
red for another
two months
but then they go to vermont when they
fly
beautiful tropical vermont vermont
they fly from los angeles presumably
they never establish where it's at but
we know we know we know we know can you
find a section
anywhere anywhere [ __ ] anywhere in
l.a where there's just not
palm trees in your shot for vermont
can you handle that a a blank room
would have worked what is this john
carpenter's halloween
they did a pretty good job of that
except when you see the outdoor school
hallways outdoor schools that's absurd
there's a couple palm trees that show up
there's a couple yeah yeah yeah outdoor
school
hallways and lockers in the midwest that
doesn't exist
it had anfield illinois yeah no i was
like why are the lockers outside as a
kid
i have only seen that in summer school
with mark summers
mark harmon mark harmon mark summers is
the double durga that's the double dare
guy
mark summers wasn't in summer school
so that's how you know mark summers was
the double dare guy
i've got my own methods and it's been
working thirty percent of the time
okay i still get better oh that's less
than chance
look the important part is that they go
from la to vermont on air alaska
on alaska airlines but they go home
oh here they are they're getting fedex
back
they hid themselves in boxes to save
some money
they spent so much money on the tickets
okay they they had to fly uh freight
can you just sit there by the airport
just wait for a different plane to go by
they waited for one plane they can't
wait around any longer rich
we got a plane it's a plane although
someone who's like 30 should think of
these things these are high school
things
or or i should say junior high school
things when you make a movie in junior
high school you know
we're trying going on a trip everybody
you just film any old airplane that
leaves the airport
not realizing the markings on it say
fedex
semi i guess he's pretty grown up right
yeah
too grown up for that kind of mistake
yeah yeah
grown up enough to have lop ship
ben uh and arthur have been together for
long enough where they know they want to
get married
but ben did not tell arthur that he
was already married to a female right
i need to tell you something
teleported i have a mutant superpower
i'm a vampire
i'm still finishing up a divorce with my
wife
oh we should have told him that before
he bought the tickets
and non-refundable tickets they're
non-refundable
uh who shows up at their apartment she's
very upset she doesn't believe he's
actually gay
uh and then she comes back with a gun
just two scenes her first scene is
where have you been why are you living
with this man
yeah and then he says i'm a i'm a
homosexual
and she says uh no you're not you're
just confused and he said get out i want
a divorce
and she says no way mister next scene
arthur was completely unaware that he
was married what
i guess so you think that would have
been a spot of drama right there
dear diary i can't believe ben he's
married to some [ __ ] named tammy
you think that just that's that's you
know why didn't you tell me that's some
drama right there
it's just never brought up again it's
just it's just gone it happened
like arthur's hair it's just gone
but then the second time the wife shows
up uh she brings a gun
yes everyone in this film has guns they
have a gun okay
and it's like it's like that plastic
squirt gun
that everybody has with like it's like a
nine millimeter like a like a cop gun
right
yeah and then it has the sliding back
trigger it's like a pellet gun or a
water gun
everybody has it in the whole world and
you you could spray paint it flat black
and it's a great movie prop right um
apparently according to the credits it
was
rented by hollywood rentals
and then once once their deposit their
deposit check bounce for the rental of
the gun hollywood rentals took their gun
back and then they had to use a space
gun
they had to go to the dollar store and
get sci-fi guns
oh now he's got a oh no space gun oh my
god
it comes from the future look it's
either the gun of the apartment we gotta
choose one
or to eat ramen noodles this week we
gotta we have to make the tree i already
repossessed my air
the mattress man came for the air
mattress i'm awkwardly sleeping on
arthur now
uh arthur's brother a
devout christian and possibly closeted
gay
has a gun where'd you get that from yeah
this little puppy is the same one i use
to kill that little [ __ ] friend of
yours when you're little
what oh this is new
[ __ ] you know that you know what i
should have done back then
he said that gun since he was little
yeah
and it's mentioned that he murdered uh
arthur's friend gay friend when he was
little this is a very
late movie revelation very late with the
same gun yeah
they all have the same gun until it's
replaced by a
a buck rogers water gun does the priest
have a gun
the priest does not have a gun the
priest has a cardboard
cross they have a
lawyer they hire a lawyer because even
though they got married in vermont
they're worried about the legalities of
getting married in california
of it being yeah counted as a real
marriage so obviously the brother had to
hire a private detective
which he didn't really use and then
killed the lawyer's assistant
yeah he steals himself parking garage
and just shoots her point blank in the
face
an innocent attorney the detective
man's on the case no that's the that's
the brother
oh that was the brother that's right
that's right
my brother is a homosexual he's going to
be marrying a man
i need to find out what his next move is
and i need to stop this insanity
what his next move is probably to get
married
yeah well they are married that's true
but what
his next move after getting married
because he doesn't want them
progressing with their marriage see i
think i think
the idea of this movie is that they are
oppressed by society and told they can't
get married
so the result of that if you just let
them get married
they could just live a happy life and i
think that's that's kind of the
motive of the movie is that because of
that roadblock
of them not being able to get married it
just leads to tons of blood
it just leads to bad things so let
gays get married which has happened by
now
yes this was 2002. yeah um and so that's
but that's the premise of the movie is
that
a chain of events just leads to death
and destruction because
of this roadblock of them not being able
to marry the worst
mistake that arthur made was going to
his
religious brother he may not have known
he was religious that's
that was one of the big laugh out loud
moments of the movie he shows up
and he's like this guy opens the door
who looks like andy dick
in a bathrobe and he's like he's like hi
i'm
it's me i'm your brother arthur he's
like arthur
i haven't seen you in seven years we're
35 years old
since you were 31 or 28.
hey vic it's it's me your brother arthur
arthur i i haven't seen you in what at
least seven years
you basically look the same uh yeah i
haven't seen you in 25 years i've been
seeing you in seven years i haven't seen
you since we were two years old
they don't should have been like i
haven't seen you since
i was nine and our parents kicked you
out when you came
out oh yeah there you go yeah
something to tie that together some are
very religious parents
you can make it you know uh very
expository if you want
but uh he goes to his brother who lives
in the nastier apartment it's even worse
it's like [ __ ] on the walls like like
literally there's [ __ ] on the walls
yeah and he's got a holy bible and he
starts asking him immediately about
jesus and then
arthur thinks it's a great idea to ask
him for two grand
to to go back to school to learn
business
to open a gay porn shop yes look perfect
investor
why does he need two thousand dollars
for my tuition to college
oh
don't ask me ask the movie
you might get an answer i'm not used to
that i know
what kind of little business you're
running oh do you
tell me how did you find that out
because i hired a private investigator
a what a private investigator and he
told me that you're running a porno shop
you know i can't i can't believe you did
he start doing that off camera
that was his dream i know he mentioned
it was his dream but
we didn't see him do that as far as i
know it hasn't happened
you know the brother's wealthy because
he has a poster of a monet painting
and he owns two calves
the cat was in the little play tower
that was like literally six inches
behind them when four people
were crowded together having dinner and
by dinner you mean graham crackers
grandfather they went over to their
brother's house for them fancy
grandparents
what's so funny what is it going to take
you
to realize that you've got to get you've
got to divorce that guy look
you've got to accept jesus as your
savior jesus
he becomes like the wily coyote he keeps
showing up like sneaking up in their
apartment
at one point he uh tapes a magic
potion to their door this is the
weirdest thing
well i have a secret holy water recipe
that you can give arthur the
cleanse of all these demons that possess
them turn straight how does it work
just make him drink it i really need him
to stop being gay thank you
and he's shocked when it doesn't work
yeah i can't believe they didn't just
take that
uh magic potion that take the door off
and drink it why didn't they do that
yeah yeah it's victor look i'm gonna
the potion didn't work can you believe
it can you believe it
can you believe it you know what i can
i thought for sure taping it to the door
would do the trick
arthur knows that it's his brother's
potion
that will expel the demons from him he
knows immediately he knows all about
this somehow it's never brought up
it's some stupid potion for my brother
it's supposed to free demons out of your
soul when you drink it
that's stupid i'm gonna throw this away
with this
it's called vodka
so glad that was resolved see what
now logic would say what what should
have happened rich
uh he should have said open the door saw
the bottle and said what's this
no and then just throw it in the garbage
but movie speak
arthur right protagonist clearly
brother knocks on the door my brother
i'm so sorry for being
mad that you were gay you know i the
jesus is the great
the great one and he will he will
forgive you for your sins
i i also want to forgive you let's let's
have a dinner
and let's talk about this and maybe you
know we could work it out
the arthur says great i'll cook up some
ramen noodles and hot dogs
i uh while the ramen noodles and hot
dogs are boiling i'm gonna go in the
bathroom
arthur's brother pours the potion in
in their fago cola and um
they're in wine glasses they're fago
cola in wine glasses
and it tries to trick them to drink the
demon expulsion potion
i like that you're being logical but
still realistic to their production
level
that's that's a lifestyle yeah yeah
everything you just said works on
multiple levels right that's good
um and so that's that's what would
happen but instead he takes packing tape
and he doesn't have it ready before he
walks over to the door so this is an
awkward moment
he spends like 30 seconds trying to get
to the table you think
ben and arthur would have all the
packing tape from their fedex flight
but the the christian brother has access
packing tape
i don't know maybe maybe they left them
some of the fedex tape it's just like a
a housewarming party after the graham
cracker dinner
we brought you some tape that was a cut
scene a deleted scene
we got this from our flight from uh
complimentary from fedex air
yeah from our uh vermont vermont so we
got out this remark
it was what they passed out in the third
class
the stewardess passed out like packing
tanks
and peanuts bubble peanuts oh yeah
airline peanuts peanuts a whole new
meaning on a fedex flight
maybe maybe that's why they use the
footage of the fedex plane
so we talked about the brother we've
talked about how he's religious i think
we need to talk about his church
yes yes let's talk about the church his
children's elementary school uh
production level church okay so you're a
no budget filmmaker you have
very little money and you have a 560
square foot apartment
in hollywood california and in the
dingiest
apartments maybe an apartment building
that was once
a motel in the 1950s could be converted
to an apartment complex right
you can only film when your roommates
are at
the restaurant and your six other
roommates are working at the restaurant
their shifts at the restaurant that's
the only time you could film you have a
half an hour window
you have to factor in time wise the time
it takes to deflate the air mattress and
re-inflate the air mattress before they
get home
so that eats up you know a decent amount
of production time because the one works
the the like the graveyard shift at the
coffee shop and he comes home
at six a.m and he wants to go to sleep
on the air mattress so you can't have
this
this big set in the living room he needs
to go to sleep
um you have 37 minutes a day that you
can actually shoot your film yes
so taking in into account those those
hindrances how do you shoot in a church
do you go into a local church and say hi
we're making a gay movie
into saint peter's cathedral and they
say
no then you're done right what are your
options rich oh well
of me if i if i were making this movie
what would you do
i would probably actually look for a gay
friendly church because these places
exist and say we are are making a movie
that's all about our our plights and
struggles to sell the the soldiers
in the lgbt community would you would
you please
let us film our scene in your church we
have some powerful things we would like
to say
like a episcopalian church yeah right or
or or you could go to home depot
and get some styrofoam insulation walls
some cardboard but put a little bit of
like paint on there with a sponge
and then like cut out some like
construction paper stained glass windows
what about the cross how do you make a
cross one cannot just
simply find a cross
well the the air mattress they had to
buy last week came in a cardboard
box oh so you know you just
efficiently you use what you have on
hand which was the cardboard box
from the air mattress you bought last
week to fashion across
what if is it this the cardboard box
that the eighth roommate uses as a
bathroom
bathroom you don't have bathroom
privileges until you pay over 800 a
month
he only gave us half the rent last month
we're gonna use this bathroom to make
our crust
oh we made this cross out of a bathroom
a cross is literally uh two
straight lines right no you can buy two
cheap pieces of wood and and glue them
together correction
you could find you could buy these
that are straight but instead of cutting
you you could go
to the dollar store and just buy a piece
of foam board
and use a ruler to cut out something
that's straight and one piece
wait who is the money for a ruler rich
you're talking about multiple things do
you have to purchase here
which is los angeles too it's the 20
store
you think real estate's expensive there
oh and i also might use like a folding
table as the pastor's desk
i don't know if we've ever talked about
this before in the many times we've
watched this film that folding table
that's probably the same folding table
that he uses for his computer desk right
yeah it's gotta be right it's in the
it's a
well we were wondering if the uh uh
church scenes were shot in the apartment
yeah because it's basically one wall set
well you can see there's a stained glass
window in the church and there's
obviously light
coming in through that like sunlight but
you can also
kind of see it looks like it's leaned up
against like the the border of like a
patio door it's it's not foam boards
foam boards would have been smarter
no yeah yeah it's that heavy kind of
like
like almost like um it's like that
paneling material
because it's it's foam boards are rigid
if you're going to buy that paneling
material
just buy the one that's got bricks
printed on it man
i know i know this is flimsier than that
type of panel material i'm talking about
because you see in one shot you see it
wavering you see it wobble oh okay
yeah okay it might be uh
just like a thick cardboard like a thick
cardstock that's possible see also too
they they appear to have painted it to
look like
like a brown beige's marble color
right yeah and they make faux
like bathroom stall shower walls that
are that
are made to look like fake marbles see
this is all like diy
like like low budget movie stuff and
this would still look like crap
but at least it would have been a lot
better the thing with fake walls and we
learned this from shooting gorilla
interrupted
give your men this pepsi of crystal as a
reward
um is they have to be able to butt
together
right and half inch foam insulation is
the way to
go um one inch is a little excessive
half
inch is enough where it's rigid and you
could put something on it
remember you can even get marble
um sticky paper yeah that you can roll
out
it just takes a little time to get the
bubbles out but you could make fake
marble
on foam board and have it be somewhat
effective
more effective than paint on a flimsy
eight by four because we see pedaling we
see two pieces of that paneling they're
not connected they're not connected you
see
like a shadow between where the two of
them are kind of you see the corner
where there's light bleeding in through
the corner
they could they should have just shot in
front of a white wall and it would have
looked better
or found because because a
a priest has a rectory
not the best name
but a priest has a rectory right and and
most times it's just looks like an
office
yeah and um you can go run inside a
church right
with your handicam or your sony vx 2000.
we see the exterior church stuff where
they clearly got it
as quickly as possible shoot an exterior
church it looks like like pervert camp
they don't know where phil means but you
know what like on a sunday
or you know even a saturday they have
weddings on saturdays at churches
go inside a church establishing yeah of
a church
cut rectory shot any old office anywhere
put some papers and i think
the most shocking part and this is a
great movie for us to talk about
because we've been shooting movies since
we were in high school
yeah you get that establishment of a
church before someone goes excuse me and
then you're out you're already done
and then you got that establishing shot
of a church but also
um they couldn't find a picture of jesus
to hang on their set oh [ __ ]
they had to draw they had to have their
kid brother draw one
hold on i'm gonna go get our picture of
jesus you keep talking i'll be right
back it looks like that famous
restoration botch
do you remember a few years ago it looks
just like that
oh [ __ ]
oh oh how how long did that take
how long did that take well that was
probably really expensive though right
a dollar a dollar what's under it's a
jesus picture in another picture so that
was that was a dollar at the thrift
store and literally a dollar
that's what the price is probably 50
cents because i'm probably it was like
half off
off one day yeah see that's also a trick
thrift stores
it's thrift stores are a gold mine for
movie props
how much prop hunting have we done in
thrift stores oh my god rich
jesus [ __ ] christ in all the years
you've been to thrift stores rich how
many jesus pictures do you think you've
seen
oh my god um it's it's
it's four it's at least four digits at
least the high
high four digits we're creeping up on
five okay
okay every time an old lady dies a jesus
picture ends up in a good world
right okay so jay we bought this jesus
photo for a dollar and an elderly lady
put
the jesus she didn't have a frame for
this exact weird size
so grandma who is now in a grave
put her jesus picture in different
frames so that she could hang
on a wall she didn't really care about
aesthetics
and clearly the dollar written in in uh
crayon
uh at the thrift store was not on there
prior oh i just erased it
it's that easy okay prior to old lady's
death this was on her wall
yeah oh that's that's another tip too if
you're really hard up for cash
at the thrift store you can just wipe
the price off
put whatever you want on there get a
little crayon
this is another diy trick um
sometimes thrift stores have the pricing
gun right
and the price a pricing gun
they they have they have stickers that
are remove
proof it's not just a solid square
that prints out on the pricing gun it
has little designed to come off and
chunks
so unless it's like shoddily put on
where you could peel it off perfectly
and move it to another item
and we've done this before um
it'll it'll peel off awkwardly sure so
we were 15.
15 to 30.
so like you see how easily i wipe that
off yeah because
it's meant to not ruin the item so it's
done with like a wax
writer or a wax marker or pen right
and um so all you got to do is bring in
your own
wipe it off with your finger and rewrite
the price but do it in the style
that whoever's been pricing at the
goodwill has been doing
and so one they're not overly concerned
about the price of this jesus picture
and then whoever's checking out at the
cash they don't give a [ __ ] don't give a
[ __ ]
yeah they sometimes they won't ring up
stuff that doesn't have a price they're
like where's the price
so if we find something that we really
need for some a prop or something
pull out that marker let's add the price
or let's
let's try to remove the sticker from an
item that has a price
if you're really careful you can do that
yeah you have to be really careful you
have to be really careful then you have
to watch over your shoulder make sure no
one's watching you
yeah there's all science to this thrift
store
this is one of many dozens of jesus
pictures we've had over the years find a
jesus picture for a dollar yeah
oh now we got to buy another one and we
do not want the relative of a man
who defies and desecrates god's holy
word here
we don't care that you murdered a woman
but your brother's gay
your brother is gay it's like the 1600s
really so the brother in his desperation
to get the demons out of
arthur so he can go back into his church
hires a thug where he goes to ben and
arthur's apartment
and then they attempt to beat ben to
death
right and it seemed that we don't see
ben well their goal is to murder him
yeah yeah because when the cop comes to
investigate him he's like oh i
i heard he was murdered and the cops
like what are you talking about he's in
the hospital
so uh his brother who has previously had
no problems
he's committed two murders yeah he's
shot people with a gun
but when he goes after ben he does not
use his gun for
some reason because the prop store
repossessed it and they didn't have the
flash
gordon gun painted yet oh okay okay oh
they had a painting but it was still wet
in the scene his assassin from the
twinkerton agency
vanished on him mid scene yeah
actually stay here long i've changed my
mind
i gotta take care of business go back to
the car wait there half an hour if i
don't come back in half an hour just
leave all right i've shown you my do you
understand
okay go now arthur says i'm going to the
grocery store
i'm going to the vons he has like a list
of 50 things to pick up at the store
no i'm good i'm good i'm going to stay
here but can you uh pick me up some
twinkies and some skittles
get me some twinkies get me some
skittles
and uh oh yeah and once you get some uh
and some soda some soda too
okay all right all right sweetie i'll
see you later
a great scene and then we get to see
arthur come out of the vons
filled with random people that don't
want to be in this movie
this is production value mike look at
all these extras
extras he gets into his car his car
pulls out and drives around
meanwhile um arthur's brother
the the closeted gay
psychopath murderous christian
and his his assassin friend from the
twinkerton agency who may or may not
be the same initial pi that he hired
remember yeah way back in the uh i think
this guy's in the assassin wing
of the twinkerton agency the other guy's
in the private investigation wing
sure he says let's go they get out of
the car they get out of their
their dodge neon with with 176 000 miles
on it
it can only it's tops its top speed is
eight miles an hour
before the carburetor explodes and then
they they say
let's go murder let's go murder
ben because then arthur will have to
become straight after that right if his
lover
and future husband is dead he will have
no choice
but to become straight what is it going
to take you
to realize that you've got to get you
got to divorce that guy look you've got
to accept jesus as your savior
jesus so they pretty sound logic in a
scene that happens off camera
ben is viciously beaten
uh by these bad guys he ends up in the
hospital
which we also don't see which we also
don't see but he survives
and then a la detective comes snooping
around
reasons unknown why he goes to the
christian brother
any any guesses uh we're looking for a
if you know anything about a mr ben
sheets
any information on mr ben sheets oh yeah
he's dead
um what else you want to know who told
you he was dead
why do you say that probably when they
interviewed arthur after the fact who
might have done this
i'd say my homophobic prick brother okay
do you think's fair yeah
yeah the detective is on the couch that
doesn't amount to anything
what happens after that is is arthur
kind of gets pissed off at this point
so he confronts his brother in his
brother's dingy apartment
yeah i want to know who you hired to do
that to ben you [ __ ] [ __ ]
oh no he breaks into his brother's dingy
apartment brother isn't there
and he takes his cell phone and because
arthur apparently knows how to to
hack a cell phone he opens the battery
compartment and he puts a bug
into his brother's phone where'd he get
the bug how does he know how to do this
who gives a [ __ ] we don't know but then
he goes out to his car
and he puts on walkman headphones also
bought at the dollar store
at the dollar store but then he sits
sits in his car and miraculously
not a day not two days not three days
30 seconds the brother immediately calls
the
the priest and and confesses
i try i murdered his brother and blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
got him all on tape then nothing comes
well we don't know if he got him on tape
he just heard him say it
because it's never brought up again
he didn't tape it he just heard him say
it look because
because arthur found out that his
brother tried to murder his husband
that means arthur is now going to burn a
priest to death yes yes
the priest is is kind of the root of
this problem
i need you to help me to kill my brother
and free him from the demons that
possess his soul
i see a priest is the one
filling uh arthur's brother with all
these thoughts of
uh the priest kicks arthur's brother out
of the church which
sends him on the murderous rampage a
homophobic priest
we we don't tolerate this we don't even
want you you're not being a gay
your brother is you're out of the church
[ __ ] it you're out of the church
everybody's out of the church
priest is so mad so uh
and all of his his gay rage
runs to the runs to the back door of the
church
not with a not with a canister of
gasoline because as we said
shooting this gorilla style it would
look pretty you're not going to run into
it
you've got to have some brass balls to
run into a church with an actual gas can
so he runs in with a milk carton filled
with water
pours it out he sets this priest on
fire which we don't see because
how do you shoot that you just don't
maybe it was just water those revenge
was just to pour water on the priests oh
just to mildly annoy him here's some
unholy water
oh yeah there you go and then the priest
says oh no now i'm gay
that at least been interesting
kind of stupid you know what have been
fun if he went back to the
gay dance club or strip club that he
he remember he tried to get a job oh
yeah and
one scene he was looking for a job and
he uh
he went to a strip club for a job and
didn't understand that he was supposed
to strip
right look at the owner of the strip
club's like okay dance and he dances
and there's a disco ball and some tinsel
and then he's like okay now show me a
penis
that's great no uh
let's see your penis and then he's like
i'm i'm not into this
i never thought this would be a
requirement at an all-nude gay strip
club
i'm out but he should have gone back
there curse this
this holy water make it gay holy hey
yeah and then he'll tell
the priest i had this bottle of holy
water cursed
i think somehow we're making this movie
worse but
i think it would be more interesting and
then he dumps the milk carton of of gay
you know
i'm burning and then he has to quit the
priesthood
case solved but instead he he's like i
kind of like men now
i have to leave the church but i guess
that would be too silly because this is
clearly trying to be a series this is
trying to be a drama yeah what you're
talking about like i said it sounds like
a john waters bit that sounds like
something that would be funny in a in a
comedy movie can't be an outrageous
yeah yeah i i've gone off the edge
into silliness territory this is trying
to be
uh uh dramatic tragedy yeah
but the minute you have your protagonist
set a priest on fire
while he's still alive you kind of lose
any sort of
connection to that character if this is
like what your movie's about though and
he goes on the revenge-fueled rampage
against
everybody after that then i could see
how that would work
he could become like an anti-hero which
he doesn't it'd be like
the gay falling down i'm gonna say gay
taxi driver yeah
yeah something like that that's what
they were going for but is it
yes they just failed
on every level
but instead he's done murdering after
that and he kind of goes back to normal
yeah yeah you don't have that escalation
of like oh he killed the priest now he's
gonna
try to kill his brother instead he tries
to seduce his brother
just drop the gun put the gun down
you're gonna hurt
you're gonna hurt somebody look arthur
put it down there i
am come and get me which is
really weird that well that's after he's
cracked yeah because the finale of the
film
i guess we'll just go there yeah we're
there we're there um
ben is is is laying in the futon in the
bedroom
he and and arthur is having not to be
confused with the futon in the living
room not to be confused with the futon
in the living room that appears
mid scene which was replaced by a
uh a nasty child's mattress yes
yes but arthur's showering ben is
sleeping
gabriel uh closeted christian
psychopath gay brother shows up ringing
the doorbell
uh arthur's in the shower ben says well
someone's at the door he gets up
instead of looking through the people he
opens the door
he's too trusting that's his that's his
weakness that's his downfall
and uh what is the brother's name even
do it does anybody remember no but he
shoots him
with the bucket right victor victor
thanks that's your favorite victory
sales
victory yes that's right he shoots ben
with the space gun repeatedly
oh ben but ben takes the time to put on
a white t-shirt
before going to the door look through
the people before you answer it
oh my god
oh no
oh better put on a white shirt too
and he gets murdered he's definitely
dead at this point yeah which is what
victor should have done in the first
place
ben is dead arthur comes out of the
shower
and cradles ben's dead body not before
putting on a white t-shirt putting on a
white shirt you have to wear a white
shirt
victor takes out some rubbing alcohol oh
yeah
which he uses to knock arthur out with
yeah this movie's logic is if you pour
anything
into a cloth and then put that cloth on
someone's mouth it'll make them pass out
because we've seen that in movies
yeah i want them to fall over the entire
wall to get knocked down
he does it to the priest uh arthur does
it to the priest
with like a nail polish remover
it just works it smells strong yeah
obviously it must knock you out i guess
i i've never tried it so who knows yeah
it's not
it's not uh chloroform right well that's
the idea that's
that's what you pour into the cloth and
put over someone's mouth then
you get a glass bottle
a brown glass bottle light resistant
glass bottle
and you get a white piece of paper from
your computer printer and you write
chloroform
print it out get some some clear packing
tape
you know what even even if it's just
that kind of brown bottle that looks
chemically it doesn't even need a label
you're lose it doesn't
look like nail polish remover yes we
know what kind of bottle that rubbing
alcohol comes in
right rubbing alcohol comes in a very
specifically shaped bottle as
does nail polish remover yes it's a
lady-like bottle
it has a lady-like shape um good because
you don't want to drink this [ __ ]
right yes exactly that's why i shape
like that
that's why they don't put corrosive acid
in eye dropper bottles right like like
aluminum coke cans
aluminum coke cans i eye dropper bottles
yeah
anything that does not serve the purpose
of
what it is but yeah you could find a
brown glass box
american science and surplus oh yeah i
don't know where those are
another good place to go for props is
that just in the midwest or
there's a there's a there's a wonderful
store that exists
or it doesn't anymore the coronavirus it
might be gone it's called american
science and surplus it's where your
nerdy
uh junior high school science teacher
would go to get stuff
they also have leftover crap from
machinery world war ii gear
anything projectors beakers speakers
science lab coats anything you want
good prop [ __ ] um but yeah gold brown
bottle like that in a rag
you don't got to get a ladies nail
polish remover from
cvs you could go you could you could
turn it up a notch
head on down to the american science and
surplus i'm sure hollywood and los
angeles have their own
kind of store they went to the prop
store to get the gun
they rented a property just just these
these simple tips they'll bring you all
the way from better than arthur up to
len kabaczynski
these simple tips yeah that's true so
the the
the brother knocks him out with a nail
polish remover
and then he transports him nowhere
because they're still in the same
dingy apartment and then he
forces arthur to be baptized in his tub
in what we are dubbing the oscar scene
yeah
this is where it's like oh he's fearless
he's getting naked on camera he's
he's a fearless actor with no vanity
uh this is the moment yeah this is going
all the way to sundance baby
get up let's picture the landlord coming
in
gotta change the air filter but instead
it's incredibly awkward because yeah we
don't want to see him naked
we're seeing him naked i mean i i
understand the idea of like oh it's just
me this
this raw emotion and this fearlessness
but it's just
i don't know i'm just picturing like
there's only two actors and one
cameraman
and that's the only crew for the movie
so it's just incredibly awkward to watch
yeah yeah
he's not really baptizing him he's doing
it
as a way to like show his power right
i'm gonna [ __ ] baptize you by your
against your will
again like i'm sure we've mentioned this
many times throughout the history best
of the worst but you see that scene and
you can picture in your head what the
filmmakers
were probably trying to do you thought
it was it's very it's
it's handheld it's very like shaky cam
he's naked
it's raw it's emotional that's the idea
so then gets baptized and then the
seduction occurs
well he figures out that his brother is
crazy because he's
he's closeted himself and so then he he
angrily tries to seduce his brother
but in in terms of the story until the
very very
end it never comes up it should have
been like that dinner scene right
there's a dinner scene he's there with
another man but that guy is like who is
that guy
it's just a friend from the church
friend from the church that's an
important scene because the friend from
the church is like
he's like come come have dinner with my
brother and
his his husband boyfriend yeah right and
try to swayed them and he's like he's
like yeah so
being married and having kids is the
greatest thing ever when are you having
kids
so arthur when do you plan to have kids
no i'm sure as soon as
arthur gets a beautiful wife and
children then that's when
he'll have a nice family he's going to
correct arthur and so
that guy that character in the sweater
is there
as the straight guy and the brother
victor is there to kind of persuade them
more drastic measures definitely more
drastic measures for these two idiots
definitely so it ends in the most tragic
way possible because that's how you end
your
your gritty indie drama every tragedy
everybody dies
oh no
another gun was just laying there on the
futon that's facing the
the kitchen
yeah well the other shot there was a
mattress there
oh everybody's dead oh oh it ended
so tragic look i don't know about you
but i thought it was shocking
powerful and raw
rich have you been writing articles for
the village voice again
cut to inappropriate music over the
credits that is also copyright free
also known as the wedding it's the song
that everybody plays at every wedding
which i guess thematically has a purpose
but
should have gone back with the
entertainer right scott joplin's 1901
classic the entertainer
that plays over the opening credits
right with with
with stock footage of jupiter
i think it's jupiter really i don't
remember
we just watched it i don't remember it
right it's credits over some kind of
weird like
it looks like a lava lamp but i think
it's
it's like like nasa footage of jupiter
oh i could be wrong you sure it was i'm
often wrong
are you sure it wasn't uranus
anyway the film has some lofty ideals it
aims very high but
it ends up shooting very low it ends up
shooting itself
on the front the chat's shooting solo it
shoots itself in the foot mainly because
the guide had had no idea how to make a
movie yeah it shows
it has all the pitfalls and pratt falls
of a terrible
low budget movie well you know ben if i
ever get killed
maybe you can take that insurance money
and just go ahead and buy 100 bikes
you don't want to take away from the the
importance of the social
message in the film and the filmmaker's
intent
but when they fail so horribly you just
can't help yourself
you fuck"
go ahead and watch it and have a good time and, uh, enjoy ben and arthur
is that a gremlin
