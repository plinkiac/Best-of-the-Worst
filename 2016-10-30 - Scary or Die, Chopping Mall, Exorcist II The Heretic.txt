Mike: Hello, Rich
Rich: Hello, Mike
M: Welcome to our annual Halloween episode of Best of the Worst
R: It’s a Halloween episode? [Looks around at the decoration] Eh
M: What? Aren’t you scared?
R: No, this is not very scary
M: Well...you’re about to be scared! Hit it, Josh! [Josh puts a red plastic filter over their lamp(?)]
R: AH!!! Oh my god!! What the fuck is that?!
M: And look out behind you! There is a styrofoam pumpkin! [Rich slowly turns around]
R: OH MY GOD!!!!
M: Don’t touch it! [Rich spins the pumpkin around]
R: Jesus oh creepy (?) [The skull on the opposite shelf falls, Mike catches it] 
M: Oh god--
R: Ahh! [They both scream]
[They suddenly stop]
M: We have three films selected for this Halloween spectacular [Rich is removing cobwebs from his hands]
R: Okay
M: Our first film is called….Scary or Die
R: Uh huh
*Scary or Die*
M:: Not to be confused with the website Funny or Die. Which is also scary because of how unfunny it is [Stares at the camera]
[Demons laugh] Uh, it stars Bill Oberst...Jr, and Cordon Bleu Chicken [Rich laughs] ‘Cause I can’t read what it says
R: I hope his stage name is actually Cordon Bleu…Wouldn’t that be amazing?
M: Yeah. And he gets scared really easily ‘cause he’s a chicken [Silence] “After 5 strangers attempt to escape a horrifying fate. One is mauled by a flesh-eating clown….” So they’re attempting to escape--
R: So is that like an upgrade?
M: Yeah
R: To their previous situation?
M: Yeah. The--they were attempting to escape a different horrifying fate?....And then one of them just--
R: [Chuckles] They..or they just fleeing a garden variety serial killer at the start of the film?
M: The way it’s written, it seems to be the case, um…[Looks over the back] uh, oh! “One is mauled by a flesh-eating clown, infected by the maiming. Emmett succumbs to a terrifying metamorphosis….As his body begins to change, so do his desires. Placing the lives of his friends and family in jeopardy.” That’s it
R:....Okay!
M: The--uhh...his clown desires?
[In the screening room]
Jay: Oh, is he gonna grow a clown nose while they’re fucking? [Josh laughs]
JK: Yaaaay!
R: Right during the climax? [Makes clown nose honking noises, Josh guffaws]
JK: He--he goes down on her and all of a sudden you hear h--honk! [Everyone laughs] “Ba--baby? Baby, what was that?
JH: And then confetti, pfff!

[3:27] R: Are they all gonna be clowns? This is, like, different short stories isn't it?
J: Uh, I don’t know, is that what’s supposed to be happening? 
R: (?) they have different stories they watch off of the Scary or Die website
J:.....Ohhhh
JK: Ohhhhhhh
R: This one’s The Crossing
J: So this is supposed to be an anthology?
R: That’s my guess
J: Okay
JH: Well, that wasn’t clear at all
R: That’s my prediction
J: No, that was not clear at all, if that’s the case
[A dirty hand moves a mouse around] 
M: Oh, the person using the computer is a zombie 
J: Pffff!
M: Did you see that hand?
J: Yeah
M: Ok, yeah, Rich is right. Rich is always right [Rich laughs] Can’t you be wrong?
[In the VHS room]
J: Well, what’s next? [Jack grabs the next tape]
JK: Chopping Maaaall!
*Chopping Mall*
J: Newly released on Blu-ray
JK: All the high-fidelity quality for Chopping Mall [Jay chuckles] So many ways to (?) [Reads the tagline] “Where shopping costs you an arm and a leg!”
J: That’s a clever tagline
JK: That’s a great one. Chopping Mall! “The future has arrived at the Park Plaza Mall where state of the art security robots are installed as the new automated ‘night watchmen’”
[A robot makes a loud noise]
Man: They remind me of your mother [The woman next to him stops smiling] It’s the laser eyes
[Audience laughs as it zooms in on her face]
JK: “When an errant bolt of lightning short-circuits the main computer control, these protector robots turn into….killbots!”
[A robot kills a man]
[In the screening room]
J: Why did the robot kill him?
Josh: ‘Cause lightning
J: [Chuckles] Duh!
[In the VHS room]
JK: “Directed by Jim Wynorski (The Return of Swamp Thing)...Chopping Mall…”
J: [Chuckles] He’s directed 200 movies and that’s the one they pick
JK: Name a better movie than Return of Swamp Thing
J: Witches of Breastwick? The Bare Wench Project? You sound like you’re not, uh, properly informed on your Jim Wynorski filmography
JK: I’m not as up-to-date as I u--uh, since I dropped out of the Jim Wynorski fanclub…
J: Ohhh
JK: I’m not as up-to-date
J: What was the movie that uh…
JK: That really turned it around...
J: Yeah
JK: For me? I--it was, uh,  Hallocream? [Background music stops] The--his, uh, his Halloween sex parody [Jay laughs] 

[5:50] J: This is in the mall?
JH: Yeah
JK: Yeah, the shower locker room in the mall
J: The shower locker room in the mall?
JH: Yeah
J: [Chuckles] Is that a thing that exists in malls? I’m assuming not
JK: Shut up, Jay [Jay laughs]
JH: We gotta get boobs in here somehow
JK: It’s a thing that exists in the Chopping Mall
J: Okay

[6:21] [One of the killbots’ laser beams causes a woman’s head to explode, everyone cheers, Rich and Mike clap] 
JK: Excellent
[In the VHS room]
JH: Jay! Hi!
J: What’s up? That was a very spooky film we just watched
JH: Oh yeah, totally was! [Replays clip of the woman’s head exploding] [Holds up the tape] Our final movie for the night is Exorcist 2 
J: Oh my god, it’s the scariest movie ever made!
JH: No--two
J: Oh, oh my god, it’s the worst movie ever made [Plays title card] [Holds up the case] This is not a cheap terrible movie, this is an expensive terrible movie
JH: Hmm-mhm
J: This is “John Boorman’s film of Exorcist II: The Heretic,” which implies that it’s based on something?.....And it’s not? [Josh pauses and thinks] Um, it’s--it’s based on a bad dream that John Boorman had, and he--he brought his nightmare to life for all of us to be miserable with
JH: [Whining] Agaaain? I already saw Zardoz [Jay laughs]
J: [Reads the back of the case] “An ages-old evil returns for another round” [Josh sighs] I guess it’s technically true
JH: Yeah
J: Uh, “bizarre nightmares plague Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) four years after her possession and exorcism. Has the demon returned? And if so, can the combined faith and knowledge of the Vatican investigator (Richard Burton).....”
JH: Burtron
J: “(Richard Burtron)  and a hypnotic research specialist (Louise Fletcher) free her from its grasp?”
JH: [Shakes his head] Mhm-mm
J: “ Employing production design and special effects that are….dizzily exhilarating”?
JH: [Laughing] “Dizzily exhilarating”
J: I guess that’s how I would describe the whole movie, not necessarily the special effects, but--
JH: Ehh
J: “And a supporting cast (Max von Sydow, Paul Henreid, and James Earl Jones!)”
[In the screening room, “and James Earl Jones” appears on screen]
JH: [Announcing loudly] And James Earl Jones! Musical guest Ned Beatty! [Jay and Jack laugh] 
[Back in the VHS room] 
J Oh
JH: Oh boy [Sighs] Okay
J: Oh yeah, and we have an Inception machine [Points to the back of the case, Inception sound effect plays] [Overlapping dialogue] So...we’re gonna go experience John Boorman’s film of Exorcist II: The Heretic
JH: Okay. Let’s experience this and, maybe some whiskey [Walks away] 

[8:42] [Two men removes a priest’s robes while he speaks to another man]
J: “These people taking off my clothes, you see them too, right?”

[9:35] JK: We have Pazoozoo
JH: Pazoo?
JK: Cthulhu...we have--
JH: Kakomo...?
JK: Yi--yibaba--Baba Yaga?
JH: Baba Yaga
JK: What was the--
R: Baba Yaga’s just a witch. I don’t know the--
J: Baba Yaga?
JK: What was the other one?
J: What is Baba Yaga?
JH: It’s a witch
JK: From the movie
R: It’s a witch in...in, like, Russian folklore
JH: What movie?
J: Ohh
R: She lives in a hut...that walks around on two giant chicken legs
J: Oh, ok!
JH: Baba Yaga--
JK: Wait, is that a real thing?
R: Yeah
JH: Yeah
R: [Talks fast] That’s a real part of the Baba Yaga myth [Replays] Thatsarealpartofthebabayagamyth
JK: So there’s...there’s…...bagoogoo?
JH: The bagul?
JK:....Baba Yaga…
J: The bagul?
JH: Bagul
JK: Oh! The bagul. That’s what I was thinking
JH: And the babadook
JK: The babadook!
JH: Yeah
J: And then we have the “penangan,”--[*penanggalan]--which is the, uhh…the Indonesian head with guts--
JK: Yes
J:--coming out
JK: I love that movie
JH: Yeah, I love that movie, I wish we watched that instead of all the movies we watched today
J: Well, the point is that all these demons have stupid names, and they make me laugh, and that takes away from their scariness
JK: True
JH: That’s fair
J: Yeah

[11:16] M: David Spade?
J: Yeah, this is Joe Dirt 3
JH: Oh boy
JK: So these guys are racists so it’s ok if they die

[12:56] [Mexicans turn into zombies and kill the racist rednecks]
JK: Also, I don’t know if the message is quite on point ‘cause now the Mexicans ARE bad 

[13:58] [The rednecks are driving in the desert]
[After a few seconds of silence]
JK: Like, where are they going?

[15:22] JK: I would like to mention, it was at that point Mike made the wise, wise decision to stop watching it
J: To turn back now
JH: Yeah
JK: And pick another movie and we decided to soldier forward, because we are dumb
JH: We did not listen
JK: We did not listen

[15:51] R: Sad Asian man saves a girl but the twist is that she’s a vampire, but it’s not a twist because we called it two minutes into--[Jay(?) laughs] 
[Man leans on a door holding a rose]
M: Now, will the flower drop to the floor in slow motion? [Jay and Rich laugh] 
R: Take your bets, take your bets!

[17:40] R: Maybe his bag just says “Van Helsing” because he’s a huge fan

[18:29] JH: The third one--
R: I don’t even remember
JK: Re-membered
R: Oh my god!
JK: Wahhhh [Rich and Jack laugh]
J: It’s called Re-membered
JK: It’s called Re, dash, membered
R: How ironic!

[19:01] J: This was the, uh, Fistful of Yen of--
JH: Yes
J: This anthology

[23:09] J: You have to establish the mythology. And there’s another movie that did this that’s called Clown, and this is a worse version of Clown, and Clown wasn’t very good to begin with [Josh and Rich laugh]
JK: But...but I’m sure at least the director of Clown might be working other small indie films, right?
J: I--I don’t think he’s doing anything anymore
JK: You don’t think he’s doing anything--
J: No, I think he did that one movie and then he just dropped off--
JK: See, that’s why you don’t do a wereclown movie ‘cause you don’t get anywhere [Jay chuckles]
R: Jack, Jack, are you trying to defend clowns? Are you--
JH: What?
R: Are you offended?
JK: I--
J: Are you offended in this film’s portrayal of clowns?
JK: I’m...no, no, no, ‘cause you know why? The spooky clown, the scary clown, the creepy clown is fine because clowns are fun! [News article appears about creepy clown sightings] Everyone knows that clowns are fun and funny and are a joy to have around and I defend--
R: Jack
JK:--clowns
R: The only people who think that are clowns
JK: Yeah? Yeah?
R: The rest of the world thinks they are creepy--
JK: That’s not true--
R:--fuck
JK: Everyone likes a clown, everyone likes--kids love clowns
[Cuts to a Pre-Rec episode where Jack is dressed as a clown] 

[25:10] JK: “Now I’m an undead, I have, uh, supposedly, uh, uh, an eternal life of roaming the Earth and I’ve just wasted an hour watching these dumbass--”
R: Wait
JK--Scary or Die videos
R: It’s--it’s brilliant
[Pause]
[Jay laughs] 
R: It’s brilliant! These are movies so dumb that only a brain-dead zombie could enjoy them

[26:23] JK: They didn’t tell me I was gonna be on the panel so I got drunk [Jay and Rich laugh] 
JH: Oddly enough, I wanted to be on the panel so I got drunk

[27:37] JH: Does that fucking boombox have a keyboard built in on top?

[27:57] Man: You smell like pepperoni [Woman gets up from on top of him]
Woman: Well, if that’s the way you feel
Man: Wait a minute--
R: I like pepperoni!
Man: I like...pepperoni [Everyone exclaims] 
M: Rich is as smooth as that guy [Jay laughs]
[In the discussion room]
J: And it’s clear early on that their intentions are solely just to fuck. In this store
JK: Not just to fuck, to have an orgy, like--
J: Basically
JK: We want to fuck in close proximity to each other
R: No, no, no
J: If the--if the intention--
JH: No. No. No
J: If the intention is to have sex right next to each other, then I guess you gotta have to do it in one location, and why not the furniture store? But it’s not clear that that’s their intention, I think they all just want to fuck, and it’s like, if you want to do that in the mall, go...uh--you know, explore, go somewhere weird and do it, man
JK: Yeah. That would’ve given us some more locations, would’ve made it a little more fun
R: I’m gonna say the guys probably had that in mind, do it in a weird place, and the girls were just like “I just wanna (?) this nice comfy couch” [Jack chuckles]
JK: Right
R: [Stammers] But the fountain? That sounds horrible [Jay laughs] 
JH: Gross
R: That sounds fuckin’ gross
[Overlapping dialogue]
JH: Dick Miller’s out there cleaning up [Jay laughs] Don’t bother Dick Miller 
J: “We don’t want him watching us”
JK: “I’m not gonna tell you again, I am not having sex in the candy store!” [Josh laughs]
R: “I am not fucking in KB Toys!” 
[After the laughter stops]
JK: So--
J: Do you think anyone has ever fucked in a KB Toys?
JH: Yes
JK: Yes
J:….Really?
JH: Yes!
JK: Sure
J: You guys didn’t even...even--
JH: (?) work
J: Bat an eye

[30:37] J: Thanks for stopping by, Dick Miller

[31:15] [Two characters roll their eyes dramatically]
JK: “Ok, so I want you guys to roll your eyes, but I want you to imagine that everyone is watching from very far away”

[31:42] J: In a perfect world, Chopping Mall would be released through Criterion

[32:15] J: “I wasn’t gonna come back until you showed your boobs”
JH: “I forgot!”
J: “I forgot you had those”

[32:34] JK: Look at his face, I love it! It’s comedy!
J: He doesn’t even look human
JH: Well….
JK: He looks like one of those photoshops where you take the eyes, the nose, and the mouth and shrink it

[33:32] J: And then his girlfriend’s butt goes out to look for him

[35:55] R: They didn’t have guns in malls in California. Maybe in--maybe in Alabama…. [Jay laughs] Mississippi….The scariest thing you’ll find in a Californian mall is pizza with pineapple
J: Pfffftt! Pizza with pineapple is the best pizza [Rich looks at him with surprise] (?)
R: I don’t know who you are anymore
J: That’s my favorite pizza
JH: Rich--
J: Pineapple and Canadian bacon
R: OH MY GOD!! The two worst things
JK: What the fuck are you talking abou--[Color bars appear] 

[36:37] [The main characters grab weapons, one of them is carrying a propane tank]
JH: Wait, there’s--they just give him propane? [Rich laughs] 
JK: “We might wanna grill out later!” [Jay and Josh laugh]
[In the discussion room]
JK: Someone walks out with a propane tank
R: It was the most useful thing they had
J: It was
[Plays clip of the men and a robot shooting each other]
R: These robots have horrible aim

[37:34] J: It’s like the kid in junior high, when you steal his glasses throw ‘em over his head to your friend
JH: Aww, you asshole!
JK: Yeah!
J: I’m not saying I do that, I’m saying that’s a thing that bullies do [Jack looks behind the camera]
JH: Hmm
[Pause]
JK: I think Jay was a bully

[40:21] R: The robots might hunt them down
[Pause, Jay chuckles]
R: Hunt them down
J: You sound like you said they might hump them down

[40:34] J: Is that the robots’ ultimate goal, they just want to get laid?
R: [As the robot] Trumpbots, grab them in the pussy

[41:17] J: Rich, what is The Exorcist II: The Heretic about?
R: I’m gonna disappoint you, Jay, I know you’re waiting for Double Down part 2 [Jay laughs] But I think I more or less understand

[43:07] [Josh explains how the hypnotism machine works]
JH: It hypnotizes both of them
R:.....Oh
JH: And then they rotate the suites(?) somehow
[Silence]
R: So--so it’s dumb?

[44:16] [“Best of the Worst Fun Fact: Richard Burton suffered from cirrhosis of the liver!” appears on screen] 

[47:15] JK: It’s a fucking science fiction movie about a demon, who fucking cares?
JH: Me. I had to watch it

[47:29] J: [To Jack and Rich] It’s very bizarre, because I usually like, like, we’re--[indicates Josh and himself]--the ones that like the weird abstract stuff, and this movie’s just like, nonsense, and you guys are defending it. And we’re in, like, bizarro world

[48:33] J: You know what I loved about the original Exorcist? All the science fiction

[51:08] JK: That was that scene, by the way
JH: Yeah, it was
JK: Made no sense. ‘Cause I’m actually in c--
J: Are you saying that the film had a scene that didn’t make any sense?

[52:00] [They discuss how the guy had so much money to spend on trips]
R: Look, he was saving up that money for a trip to Disney World so he could find some--nevermind
JK: [Into mic] I think that was a child molestation joke. Pretty good--it was a pretty good one 

[59:05] R: [Points to the camera] Suck on that, metaphors!
