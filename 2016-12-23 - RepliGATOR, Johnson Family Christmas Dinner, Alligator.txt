Jay: Merry Christmas, Jack!
Jack: Happy Holidays, Jay!
J: I see we’re both wearing our hipster pop culture Christmas shirts
JK: Mine has a Star Trek
J: Mine has a Gremlins [Silence] Well, Jack, uh, 2016 is almost over and it’s been a pretty sad year, you know, we’ve, we’ve lost a lot of really respected and celebrated artists and celebrities, and we just wanted to take a moment to honor their memory [Celebrity faces and names scroll by, sad music plays]
JK: Lotta--lotta artistry...in that list, uh--they--they will be missed, but you know, at least we still have Miles Teller [Sad music stops playing]
J: Miles Teller? He was my favorite part of no movie he’s ever been in!
JK: Hey! That’s enough of this sentimental bullshit! Let’s get to watching bad movies and talking about them
J: Well, I have to explain the gimmick this year, Jack
JK: Oh, we got a--we got a schtick? 
J: We got a schtick, last year was, you know, A Very Cannon Christmas, where the package would be either a Christmas special or movie, or a Cannon film, so we’re doing something similar this year and we’re calling it Christmas or Crocodile…...where it’s either a Christmas film or a movie with a crocodile in it [Mike and Rich chuckle in the back] Or--or! An alligator. Just because, just a crocodile would be pretty silly, so…
JK: And whose...whose idea was this? Who came up with this gimmick? [Camera pans over to Rich, Rich spins his camera around to face him, Jay and Jack laugh] 
JK: So--[Jay laughs] so, Christmas or Crocodile
J: Yup!
JK: This--I mean…
J: This is where we’re at, Jack
JK: Ok, so I get to pick a present
J: Just pick a present, open it up and we’re gonna see what we get
JK: Any present here? [Touches some presents, then reaches for one] I’ll--oh--I--I’ll choose the one furthest away from me, how about that? 
J: All right [Jack tries to rip the wrapping paper] Oh my god, he’s so weak. This is industrial Christmas wrap
JK: That is actually really strong [Jay chuckles] Okay [Removes the paper, shows off the box] It’s a penguin [Removes the lid, laughs] Oh no--ho--ho--ho--ho! I--
J: Jack? What’s our first film?
JK: [Chuckling] I don’t know whether I won or lost [Shows off the tape] 
J: It’s--
JK: It’s Repligator
J: Well, I mean, look at that cover, I think we’ve won [RepliGATOR title card appears] Well, we got--it’s an alligator head...
JK: Hmm-mhm
J: On a hot babe bikini body--
JK: Yup
J:--body...but also some sort of sci-fi laser? 
JK: Oh, I didn’t even notice that [Reads the back] “A military experiment gone awry. Brutes turned into hot nympho babes with insatiable sexual appe--” [Stops reading]
J: Oh no, are we gonna watch a porno?
JK: This--this, uh, this is softcore pornography
J: No, the--the--
JK: There’s a pornographic image on the back of this
J: That’s not a porno--
JK: That is a topless lady
J: Typical exploitation...crap [Mike turns the camera towards Rich, he points to himself and mouths “what?”] 
JK: [Reads while Mike and Rich are doing their thing] “Nothing can stop them from reaching their orgasmic peak--”
J: Oh no…[Chuckles]
JK: “turning them into vicious alligators!” Okay….nevermind, I’m super I’m bored [Jay huffs] So, they have to orgasm to turn into an alligator
J: Well, Jack, it looks like Christmas is gonna come early this year [Rich laughs] 
JK: Wooow

[4:12] [Rich and Mike are at the tree]
Rich: Well, that was, uh, Repligator. Would you like to pick a present now, Mike?
Mike: Sure, what are we doing, it’s Christmas or Crocodile, right?
R: It’s Christmas or Crocodile
M: To remind our viewing audience
R: They...the way that this is edited that just happe--that ju--they just saw that. They ju--
M: Oh! Yeah
R: They didn’t sit through the movie
M: Yeah….Alright, so I pick a tape?
R: Ye--yes! Pick a--pick--pick--pick thing. What do you got? What do you got?
M: Let’s see...well, I’m gonna go for this one with Star Wars wrapping paper on it
R: ‘Cause it’s got fucking Star Wars on it?
M: [Holds up the box] What says “Christmas spirit”...
R: You like--you like…
M:...like Kylo Ren?
R:...you like Star Wars? Star Wars ™ Star Wars?
M: Star Wars ™ Kylo Ren ™ Stormtrooper ™ [Starts ripping the wrapping paper] Okay, Santa, I’m gonna open my gift now [Loudly removes the paper, holds up the box] It says “frosty,” I thought it says “Jesus” for a second
R: [Chuckling] With a big penguin? 
[Mike removes the lid, looks at the tape]
M: What is this? [Takes out the tape] 
R: I--you tell me, you opened that shit
M: Ok, Rich, “Black Christian Movies presents” you wrapped this?
[Johnson Family Christmas Dinner title card appears]
M: And--and some silica gel...to keep it…
R: Well--
M:...not moist
R: I didn’t wrap that--[Mike pretends to eat the silica gel]--but the silica gel came with the boxes that I bought
[Silence]
M: Um so…
R: [Overlapping with Mike’s dialogue] To keep the boxes moist
M:--the film, it’s called Johnson’s Family Christmas Dinner and there’s a very large child hiding under the table…
R: [Into his mic] He’s a fucking asshole
M: They’re going to eat a turkey. Uhh, oh! Uh, I’m just shocked at your selection of films [Flips over the tape] “Spirits will be lifted--”
R: [Grabs his mic again] He’s been wanting to watch this for months. He’s been--
M: Okay--
R: He’s been looking forward to it
M: “Spirits will be lifted and lives renewed. It’s Christmas time at the Johnsons and there’s a whole lotta drama! Robert is suffering from a developing drinking problem due to his pending divorce [As Mike reads, Rich thinks about a woman turning into a dinosaur in Repligator] Meanwhile, Sam finds every opportunity to rub his success in Robert’s face”
R:....Oh no!
M: “Candy invites her vagina--” oh! [Chuckling] “Candy invites her vegan boyfriend….” that was a--that was a...Freudian slip
R: You really can’t have a vagina boyfriend
M: W--we--I--I saw the V word….um--
R: You see, like, every time you see a V word you think it’s a vagina? 
M: Well, Candy and--uh--it’s, you know, who’s named Candy? Other than like a stripper? Um, “Aunt Michelle is praying for a man and someone gets busted for smoking in the house!” 
[Silence]
R: Crack, right?
[Mike covers his mouth]
M: “Uncle Steven struggles to bring everyone together to enjoy this Christmas dinner. This sequel…”?
R: Sequel?
[Poster for Johnson Family Vacation appears, under it it says “sequel to this????”] 
M: Maybe they have Thanksgiving dinner was the--[Rich laughs]--first one, I don’t know. “This sequel will make you laugh and cry! This Christmas dinner will be one that you’ll never forget!!”
R: Alright! Let’s go watch half the movie and lie about watching the whole thing! [Mike laughs] 

[7:45] J: “Just a goddamn stupid book! I wanna watch Transformer 2, I don’t wanna read Shakespeare”

[8:15] M: There’s the mic! I saw it again!
J: Oh, did ya? [The mic dips into the shot] Wait--
R: Hey, hey!
J: Hey, we got a mic!
M: See, I wasn’t--I wasn’t making it up [Jay laughs] 
JK: Mike! No, that was the joke, the filmmakers, “good little retard, good little retard”
M: Holy crap
JK: Yes
J: That’s not very Christian
M: Nooo, hypocrites!
[At the tree] 
J: Well, Rich, we’ve got one more opportunity to let this Christmas not be the worst ever
R: Okay!
J: And we’re leaving it up to you to open the present
R: Oh my--
J: That’ll save Christmas
R: Oh my god, it’s--it’s--it’s up to me and random chance! [Picks up a present with Star Wars wrapping paper, tosses it away] Fuck Star Wars [Picks another one up] Alright, alright, here we go [Starts opening it] Here we go [Opens the box, removes the tape] Gator...Face [Jay laughs]
J: “The Legend of…”
R: The Legend of Gator Face. He was--he was only a myth, until one adventurous night
J: He was only a myth, until he wasn’t
R: Oh my god. Oh my god [Flips over the tape, reads the back] “In this fantasy family adventure…” Fuck
J: Oh no
R: I’m considering, like, just stepping on this and breaking it so we have to try again
J: “Accident.” Accident might happen? [Rich lowers the tape]
M: No, Rich, don’t do it! No, don’t do it!
J: [Flatly] Rich, stop! [Rich stomps on the tape]
R: Ohh shit!
J: Fuck!
R: Oh no!
J: Oh no, there’s been a horrible accident!
R: Oh shit! Fuck, oh--[Breaks the tape with his hands]--I--maybe I can put it back together 
J: Okay, fix it, Rich
R: Oh! Fuck!! God--
J: Oh my god
R:--dammit
J: Christmas is such a disaster this year
R: Oh my god. I’ll have to pick again
J: Oh. Unfortunately, you’ll have to pick again. This is the worst--
R: Wow. Such a tragedy. Ohh [Removes the wrapping on the new box]
J: I hope we can recover, save Christmas, Rich [Rich giggles]
M: I can’t believe we did that [Jay laughs] Had to watch that! [Rich opens the box and takes the tape out]
J: Oh-ho
R: Oh no! Alligator! [Giggles] [Alligator title card appears] Hey, there’s a half-naked chick in its mouth so that’s a step up
J: Alright, more softcore pornography involving alligators [Claps] Let’s do it
R: Film by Sergio Martino, ehh--uh--fuck it, alligator, boobs, let’s go watch it! [Starts walking away] 
J: Alright 

[11:41] R: I don’t wanna (?) I wanna die
J: Well, Merry Christmas, everybody! Uh, happy holidays
M: No

[14:17] J: Oh, his fantasy is that he has a wife that loves him

[14:36] R: “How embarrassing” [Yellow text appears on screen]

[15:42] JK: So, the main science thing in the movie was transporting a person from one place to the other place, but there was a kink in the system….not that kind of kink
R: Was that a pun?
JK: There--there was something wrong with the replicator…
M: Guy who ran the machine was (?) [Studio audience laughs] 

[18:26] R: We’re probably more closely related to alligators than we are dinosaurs [Silence]
J: But in the movie they turn into dinosaurs
R:.....Well, the--the--they look like dinosaurs, they’re supposed to be alligators
JK: You know, guys, we could--
M: Like that episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation
J: Oh goddd
R: Yeah, yeah, when they...the Barkley disease that turns everyone--
J: Charles Barkley, was he on an episode of Star Trek?
M: No--
R: Just Barkley Barkley
JK: He had to jam slam
J: He wasn’t the one with the disease, that was, uhh, uh, Magic Johnson
R: Didn’t he have...HIV?
[Silence]
[Jay chuckles]
R: What?
JK: I believe he did, yes
R: Yeah
JK: I think you’re right
M: Yeah, I don’t think it had ever turned into….AAAA--worse disease
J: Yeah
M: I don’t think it ever did. ‘Cause that’s what you get before you get AAA--worse disease [Silence] But anyway, in that episode of Star Trek--
R: You mean AAAIIIDDDSSSSS
J: [Puts his hands on his cheeks] Oh nooo!

[20:24] R: Is it the most pathetic thing we’ve watched?
M: [Quickly] Yes
JK:.......It might be the worst thing we’ve ever watched
J: [Sighs] Yeah
M: So, it’s...if that’s not true, it’s definitely up there
JK: Well, it’s like, you know, we can--you can’t say that because you say that about everything, but I think--[Jay laughs, then Rich]--the three of us can, you know, put it together to say--
R: It has some weight when we say that

[30:01] R: I think Grandpa is younger than most of them
J: Yeah. That’s the thing is he’s talking to his son and you’re like, “you guys are the same age”
M: The problem is, Jay, is that black don’t crack [Jay laughs] And like, you know, like Rich, you know, he’s 54 years old and lives in his mother’s basement, right?
J: Oh yeah, that’s--that’s--yeah, I read that somewhere
[Newspaper appears that says “54 Year Old Man Refuses To Move Out of Mom’s Basement After Winning £778, 292” with a picture of Rich on it, flashing “CLICK HERE!!!” signs appear, fast-paced music plays] 
M: So, we don’t know the ages of all these people
J: That’s true
M: Um, as white people...we age very poorly 
[Cuts to news article, music starts up again]
J: Would being black make him not live in his parents’ basement? 
[Cuts to news article again]
JK: But you won’t believe why he still does
J: Ohhh shit, click here!!
M: And somehow he won the--the British lottery [Jay and Rich laugh]
R: I thought it was gambling at a British casino
M: No, it was the British lottery. It was…
J: He had--he had a gambling addiction
M: He had a gambling addiction--
JK: I’ve never actually clicked on it
R: Oh--
JK:--clicked on it?
M: Yes. Your wife divorced you because of your gambling addiction
J: Yeah, yeah
R: I thought I won the money playing gambling…[Jay laughs] And I had to go to the gambling dot--gambling.com
M: It might’ve been an online gambling thing, like a, almost like a lottery, I don’t know
R: Okay
M: But the point is, um, I don’t know what the point is

[32:50] J: But then later they say that they just ran out of gas….
M: Well, he’s like “go get gas for the car”
J: Yeah
M: It’s--it’s--it’s….completely baffling
J: But then the next day is Christmas day and then they’re just never heard from again
R: They’re dead. They’re dead
J: Oh, did they die? [Mike makes a confused/surprised expression] 
R: They--they die all around (?) the streets 
M: Oh my god!
JK: They tried to confront the Arabs
J: Ohh! Ohhh! That’s an entire different--
JK: Actually--
R: They went on a whole Middle East adventure, actually
M: To get real oil?
JK: To get real oil, like, it was a, it was a wacky romcom adventure
J: I’d watch that movie
R: They’ll turn up in--in, uh...the Johnson Family Invade Iraq [Everyone laughs]
JK: Johnson Family: Desert Storm?
R: Desert Storm, they got--
J: Is that part 3?
R: They gotta get Cousin Larry back

[34:56] J: So we came up with a whole sequel where she goes in there--[Rich laughs]--and just shits on the bed
[In the screening room]
JK: And then it turns into, like, a mystery, who shit on the bed? [Jay and Rich laugh] 
R: That’s the movie title right there
(...)
JK: A Johnson Family Christmas
M: Johnson Family Christmas Number 2 [Everyone laughs]
[At the table] 
J: So that’s part 2, and then part 3 is the Arab adventure?
R: Yeah, the Iraqi...the Iraqi adventure
M: Well, Rich...
R: The Family Johnson--Johnson Family Invades Iraq [Jay laughs] To save Cousin Larry, who
JK: Who got the cheap homemade oil
R: Who got swindled with the homemade oil [Everyone chuckles]
M: Look, can we just get back to the plot?

[36:33] M: They--they took a...a stocking and, like, scotch-taped it to the door
J: Yeah, I noticed that on the cabinets earlier, they got, like, Santa hats just awkwardly taped…
M: To make it look Christmassy
J: Yeah
M: It’s like worse than these decorations [Indicates the lights behind him] [At the table] The--you know what? There isn’t even a fucking Christmas tree
J: Nooo
R: Yeah!
M: I mean, we have a Christmas tree! Ours looks great! 
JK: Wi--with…[Rich puts his hand on his forehead] With...with, the, uh….
J: [Laughs] Rich wants to die

[40:47] J: And then we get The Eagle and, uh, Grandpa Calrissian...they--they--
M: Yes, they’re both wearing the same wife beater
J: They’re both wearing the same wife beater, but, uh, uh...The Eagle’s like, “I know I dress weird…” and it’s like you’re wearing the same thing?
M: Sorry, that’s not politically correct anymore, it’s a spouse beater
J: [Deflates] They’re both wearing the spouse beater
M: Thanks, Jay

[41:55] M: It just ended!
J: It just stopped! It didn’t end, it stopped!
M: It just sto…
R: Oh my god!! [Jack laughs] 
J: That was the most jarring ending since Dangerous Men

[44:08] J: And our final film of the night!......[Nobody speaks] Alligator!
M: Goes to Rick Evans
J: Our final film of the night is Alligator, about a crocodile [Rich picks up the tape] Rich, would you explain Alligator?
R: Alligator is shitty and Italian [Sets the tape down] 

[46:36] J: There are some wonderful miniatures in this movie
JK: [Puts his index finger and thumb close together, mumbles something]...like this many
J: Yeah, no, it’s few and far between--
M: Jay, we call them “little people” now  

[47:12] R: [Listing all the characters] Creepy mustache man…
M: W--that--nothing happens with him
J: No--
M: We thought he was gonna rape someone

[48:03] [They list the characters from Jaws and their parallels in Alligator]
JK: You have the Roy Schneider character...Rob Schneider character...you have the--
J: Scheider
M: Roy Scheider
J: Roy Scheider
JK: You have the Roy Scheider character in the photographer, uh, you have just the--the townspeople, a.k.a. the tourists, you have the sexy black model
J: Who is of course the famous character from Jaws
M: Played by Richard Dreyfuss [Jay laughs] 
J: Oh! Rod Stewart also shows up in this film...He provides the villagers with pants and Coca Cola

[48:50] JK: I don’t think this is the right kind of dancing
J: This is dry humping
JK: This is--right? That’s a butthole over there [Jay laughs] 
Man: That’s enough! That’s enough!
R: “Stop having fun! Stop having fun, I’m done taking photographs!” [Jay laughs]
Man: How do you say “that’s enough” in their language?
J: “So I’m done taking photos, stop dry humping,” and they can’t stop [Mike nearly spits out his drink, Rich laughs] Until he brings out the pants [Mike laughs silently] Wow….I’m just explaining what happened in the movie, but…
R: There’s something ironic about somebody who can’t stop dry humping until they are brought pants 

[50:21] R: And then--and then--and then the alligator got angry at the native peoples because they sold out for jeans and coke
M: Yeah, it’s true
R: Not the good kind of coke

[54:22] R: Just for the ending I’m gonna go with the Johnson Family Christmas Dinner, just--
J: Or the lack of ending?
R: Just for the--just for the stop. Just for the way it stops [Jack laughs]
J: Because the movie...stops?
R: It’s like a ni--you know what it is? It’s like a nice surprise. Like, you’re watching it and it feels, it feels like there’s a good 25 minutes left
J: Yeah
R: And then “oh! It’s over! Look at the credits--[Gasps]--there’s credits!”
M: It’s like getting out of jury duty [Jay laughs]
R: It was like, it was like…
M: You know, you feel like you gotta ha--oh! Oh! I’m out!
R: It was like a Christmas miracle
M: It was a Christmas miracle
R: It was a Christmas miracle….Johnson Family Christmas Dinner

[55:10] J: Jack?
JK: Uh--uh...I don’t mean to get topical...but I feel like none of these represent my viewpoint very well so I’m going to not vote at all [Jay laughs]
R: So you’re saying you’re okay with all of them? Being the Best of the Worst? [Jack laughs] 
J: That’s the only way you can...uh….
JK: What I’m--what I’m--what I’m saying is I’m--I’m comfortable with any of them being the Best of the Worst because, uh, I don’t want to choose one of them, yeah
M: No vote is still a vote for Trump [Rich laughs]
JK: That’s not what we’re talking about here, Mike. That’s not what we’re talking about
M: The electoral college is gonna win...dude [Rich and Jay laugh]
