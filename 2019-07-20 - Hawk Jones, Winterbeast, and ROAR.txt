why hello rich Evans
hey Mike
it's time for another best of the worst
and this time no gimmicks no wheels no plinketto boards
just three good old-fashioned high quality films pre-selected ahead of time
oh how refreshing
I know
what's our first movie our first movie is called
Hawk Jones ha Jones features an entire
cast of children playing zany adults
with hilarious results these pint-sized
zeros play cops and robbers for real Oh
watch it amazement as our hawk Jones
gang actually drives cars battles bad
guys and win the hearts of youngsters
everywhere guaranteed side-splitting
spunky action
non-stop spunky action
what the fuck
what what did you say
why did the chicken cross the playground
to get to the other side
you'll watch it again family
entertainment rated R
children we're less than four minutes in
be great but this is all children except
for this character
Mitchell only adult in the film why
don't you tell us about our next movie
Mike winter beast the Evil Dead meets
northern exposure it's winter Beast
something strange is going on up in the
mountains of a tiny winter resort
community every time you turn around
innocent town's folks our towns folk
just say people I got to get it exactly
oh my god every time you turn around
innocent towns folk are disappearing in
increasing numbers but this isn't just
any mountain this is the Indian burial
ground of the Chuck Cora tribe no
Indians Oh dancing yes those damn
Indians what are they doing now
worse yet this sleepy towns Hills are
infested with living totem poles
creatures of all shapes and sizes and
the legend of the winter Beast oh my god
fearless park ranger sergeant bill
Whitman played by Tim are more things at
his bumbling right-hand man
Stillman are hot on the trail when one
of their Rangers returns from a scuffle
with an unknown
along the way they come upon Sheldon the
owner of the nearby Wild Goose lodge
sounds amazing it does it sounds great
I can sure hear something no yes
seamless yeah your thing looks like it's
in constant pain
oh well that sure was something
our next movie is Oh our next movie is
supposed to be roar but I I can't find
it
looking for roar right here oh my god
it's Hollywood celebrity Macaulay Culkin
sure is all joking aside let's watch
this joke sounds fantastic I've never
seen more before I was gonna do the read
but I'm a Hollywood celebrity totally I
need you to read so here's a quarter
oh oh thank you mr. Mcoy
no animals were harmed in the making of
this film
70 cast and crew members were and those
are words I love hearing the most
dangerous movie ever made
Bruce over the course of ten years war
is an audacious cinematic experience a
thriller showcasing the majesty and
ferocity of African lions filmed on
location and missed dozens of untrained
cats that's actual that's great
yeah it also in there - photographed by
Jean DuPont DP of die hard and director
of speed the result is a spectacular
achievement though often terrifying to
watch as actors not stuntman flea
wrestle and come face-to-face with the
massive hunters that sounds great writer
director no martial stars is Hank a
doctor and outspoken naturalist in
Africa who allows lions tigers cheetahs
and other big cats to roam freely around
his remote estate sounds like a good
idea while away protecting animals from
poachers Hank's family including
Marshalls real-life wife and daughter
Tippi Hedren the birds and Melanie
Griffith working girl we need to know
that that's the one I know with milk
money arrived at his home and are
stalked by massive Lions that have
overrun the house not surprisingly many
casting crew suffered injuries during
the making of the film I promise it on
the box though care was taken to ensure
that no animals are armed since filming
roar Hedren has become an advocate for
the protection of big cats founding the
war foundation and the Shambala preserve
okay well there you go you know what you
did such a good job here is my hotel
room key oh thank you so much mr.
McCulloch and I'll see you later let's
let's watch roar wait your hotel room
key
oh I guess I have to he's Hollywood
celebrity oh god oh oh my god
here on the roof it reminds me of a the
other time he was hitting me over and
over and over again and it made me kind
of reevaluate my entire life was hitting
you Oh was rich yeah it was okay cuz I
was kind of I was like more or more and
he was like I can't do it any harder no
I said my arms getting sore yeah rich
you hit mr. McCullen yeah
yeah don't you know I was asking for it
I'm Sean from bunny ears they brought me
here to spin a wheel and now I'm at a
table with no wheel in sight anyway back
to this you you briefly appeared in a
video before they didn't screen when
when you've said it unlike though
watching when rich got murdered yes
yeah I didn't get murdered I just got
seriously injured yeah you're in your
nuns cup how are your bowls by the way
they're great
is this how all these episodes go uh
well we do warm up with sloppy sloppily
introduce things welcome to best of the
worst and then it gets worse yeah
on today's episode classic regular
episode no gimmicks three films we have
a beautiful lineup
yeah all I see are lions that's
forgotten about the first too far this
has been a roller coaster yeah this is
well like one of the entirely different
reaction for every movie mm-hmm yes I
just see everyone has children now great
mags just children in life Sean why
don't you tell us about Hawk Jones sure
who seemed to hate that one the most I
did and then I'm gonna go to rich for winter beasts
no shit
no no shit
yeah well Hawk Jones
so Hawk Jones was a very confused movie
it's it's essentially a send-up of
70s I would say era film noir and like
detective buddy car there is a murder
but I don't know there is a crime wave
going on yes okay right and then there
was like a hawk Jones she's a new
detective in town who is who is who is
precinct mates yes like two T's yes and
then he gets part of partner and he's
very upset
bride the name becomes a turkey she has
cooties yes yes yes did you say that no
they can't know they don't but it's
interesting it's implied in the
narrative you think can even see them
it's probably the best structure to be
honest Oh everything absolutely yeah
there's a point ABC etc I go do what was
going on at every point during this yes
even though the sound wasn't great
you still know what's going on all those
cop cliche it wasn't well acted and it
didn't look pretty but it was definitely
it was a clear beginning what child
actors can be excellent you know what
you know what I had forgotten it did
slip my mind that I'm sitting next to a
famous child actor yeah hello Carlo did
Uncle Buck how dare you how dare you
forget Oh Dave Righetti pagemaster
how dare you forget get even with dad I
mean come on how dare he gives us both
the famous films of yours yes well how
do you feel about the sexualization of
young girls like that I didn't know was
another part where it got big words like
with a pan up from the girls like her
legs
I mean I know you're doing the cliches
but yeah let's pull back on this and
then that's a real gun just took every
piece out of it just in case you just
don't do that it was equivalent of like
a like you said jonbenet ramsey like a
beauty pageant yeah yeah where she was
singing like I look at jazzy song and
there's guys with the hats in the
background doing their thing and it
wasn't like well there are certain
things you can adult eyes yep child eyes
yeah yeah yeah and so it's like oh they
go to a bar and there there's that
remember the googly eye scene without
they're doing like these facial
movements and no idea what they're doing
together what is going on they took it
just far enough to where they knew what
line was too far to cross and we
desperately wanted them to cross that
line but the violence we wanted more
violence one of them to go over the top
yes it's either you go really really
silly with it like you know look at with
the milk kind of thing the chalk outline
yeah look yes exactly the chalk outline
was a stick figure like you know like
that's exactly that's cute or do you do
any other or like you know they get
their guns or squirt guns or nerf guns
like yes or you go the whole way where
it's kind of just like they're using
real guns
their brains get splattered on the fucking walls
yes
oh
is he shot
i guess he's shot
I guess he won a prize
yes
it
doesn't know whether it's an 80s cop
movie or whether or not it's a noir
detective 1950s film what I'd say is
Hawk Jones is timeless I think I wanted
to be a noir thing but they just didn't
want to go full noir with the sets and
the cars and the time that would be hard
they would have loved a voiceover it's
like oh yeah like July 1986 since 1980
50 yeah they should yeah this this Dame
walked into my office I knew she was
trouble the second she walked in like
even like that kind of thing they should
do a prequel but it's adults playing
child hawk joke
no I want to see a prequel that's like a
science fiction movie where science
experiment turns everyone into children
yeah well explain yeah it's like that
episode of Star Trek rascals responsible
no it's a transporter basically
basically everybody in Star Trek could
have like eternal youth if they want
they can all live fucking forever
but they
ignore this this technology thing with
him Riker like there's two wreckers now
it's like they don't have clone
themselves now with that thing they
don't turn themselves young forever card
was like III could start my whole life
over at 15 with with my current brain or
I can turn in
so Hawk Jones kid with the pipe old lady
it had little lady what's dorable who
was the youngest child in the movie the
grey level was played the oldest and she
was the most disinterested in being
there like blow her face off even gave
her a cane but then the scene where
she's like running out of the space cob
you will die nice with this department
I'd like you to meet your new partner I
need a tums also the chief was great
because he had a mustache yeah and I
will say I did count there was four
child mustaches in this movie and each
time was hilarious was it easy children
and mustaches is a must so they bring it
they bring in pretty much their
Terminator character who's covered in
chains for kind of no reason at the
beginning or his legs are and he is
terrible at his job yeah they do nothing
to set up really good to be a 7 year old
no you need crushed by the boxes we
failed the assassination attempt in the
box factory remember yes he pushed a
bunch of empty boxes on Hawk Jones what
were in the box is nothing more box
oh well Hawk Jones tried to stand on an
empty box he just goes into it so inside
it he tries to like climb up to get hit
of window and he just falls right in my
favorite character I've got to say was
Poindexter he was adorable even was
being tough he was adorable and I think
my favorite part of the whole movie is
his death scene he gets shot a million
billion times and it is my favorite that
in the ex-wife joke real quick when the
mob boss kid what was his name
Corleone some my boss came up he was
talking he was so bad it kind of
reminded me of Temple of Doom when they
had the when they had the Indian like
shaman character who spoke no English no
this dialogue like phonetically so you
will go to pankot palace to find
sivalinga and bring
and it's like you can tell like he doesn't know what the fuck he's saying
that's how that kid talks
this is my friend is a copper I think
that kid just got bored oh there was
that one yes by the end yeah see didn't
want to be there anymore
dang you know you should say hello to my
little friend
that woulda said and it would have been
a teddy bear
does this predate Scarface no no no no
this does predate home alone
there's a character named McAlister
yes
this is fucking weird
the name's mcalister turkey
we never brought up that
so this is where John Hughes stole
yes
his ideas from
pretty much draw his scripts
they callous to get in here yeah you saw
him watching this like in sequence
yeah that's good
McAllister was the girl's name though
that was the planner that was a
partner's name yeah yeah I'm very
versatile sure sure you do play an
excellent tiny black girl thank you
lockdowns
yes Rambo so they needed to feel like
the movie they needed to the start of
this they didn't have one conversation
where it was like are all of the kids
playing adults and we just everything
else was played straight they're adults
in an adult world and we never reference
that they're children
or is this like a children's family
movie Winky Winky like and then they
pull out a laser gun for the gun battle
instead of like you know and they never
had no they did and you know what the
answer was I would say they were going
more for the latter considering that it
was PG and there wasn't the violence was
mostly cartoony yeah he threw it he
throws a grenade in the bathroom stall
should be blowed up but it wasn't Looney
tune enough no yeah it should have been
like at you should had smoked the Looney
Tunes guy should have been covered in
sticky wood shouldn't covered in soot or
something right there of the mouth you
should had smoke come out of his ears
and then you go like okay nobody's gonna
argue that Hawk Jones couldn't have been
done better
they absolutely kept that in
talk about winter free whenever East was
great um rich
you loved winter beasts so you're gonna
talk about it I want to know that don't
do your past passive thing where you
just go as a movie that about a thing
that sucked that tell us in detail
everything that I don't know what
happened in winter Beast I saw winter
bees that I just seen you don't you know
there's there's three main characters
yeah there's a there's this cop there's
ginger cop where does it take place
ginger moustache first of all that's
start location it takes place in the
forest during the winter no
Massachusetts yes and specifically a lot
it takes place mostly in around a lot
location character story go Oh God all
right well there's there there is a
watch and there's a man in a plaid suit
who runs the lodge and so anyway he says
to me you think that's bad her sister is
twice ginger cob no ginger moustache
ginger moustache there's a couple of
girls sunglasses yeah does he not retain
any information watch this movie at all
do you want to do you want to do it I'm
glad you can do roar right sure I'll do
whatever lions
that's roar I'm just did it for you but
Mac you do winter boots okay as you
remember things that happen ask me to do
it
do winter be used boo me yeah okay rich
can you read this alright what are
beasts yeah there there is a lodge and
it's winter mostly summers mostly like
spring fall supposed to be
it's fall yeah I thought it was a winter
there's a fog around XE of the missile
bit small window never [ __ ] you yeah
yeah well maybe the Beast just comes out
in winter no are you all right yeah
Oh
what yes this is gonna be a movie in the
movie oh maybe I'm gonna say no yeah I'm
gonna go with no also it's so bad it's
gonna be what's happening this is oh
okay
wow that's good well yet it did the
reels out of order yeah this is real six
a dream dream close close watch and
there's some monsters that keep killing
people randomly
the stop-motion monsters pop-up they
kill people and this a cop who's concerned about this and the guy who owns the lodge isn't
and it turns out the guy who owns the lodge wants the people killed because I've got a ritual
well, he's the
he's the jaws mayor
he's the mayor of the lodge
hey I'm just trying to make conversation here
well, you're sure doing a shitty job of it
yeah
yes
oh, my god
jesus christ
yes, yes, yes
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
the lattice work
the lattice work
who's that guy
what's going on here
who the hell are you
good question
what just happened
and scene
and I don't know what happened because i don't know what happened
you have like the descriptive powers of like a four year old
you realize that, right
like the little girl telling him about what Star Wars is about
selling robots you can tell this was
shot over a long period of time because
the hair is different lengths as we go
along and a lot of the characters
costumes would change in shots all in
the same scene we'll get to that I think
every character wore that red flag
so then a group attacks a lady
yes I am grooves bright Ray Harryhausen
eat your heart out
not for winter bees get up and dig top
off because it was time you can take
your top off and then get attacked by a
tree monster okay and then I'll be
famous
there's stop-motion things that happen
they people get killed
it's very, uh, penny from a pee-wee's Playhouse
i'm a duck
you're a duck, too
let's get together
and duck-a-roo
duck
duck-a-roo
if you're such a fucking expert, why is there suddenly a zombie in the fucking movie
why does a zombie come out of a grave
and why is the grave sitting there, just in the middle of the woods
yes
oh, my god
yes
what
wait
shut up and watch
we've got a zombie mummy
this is fucking awesome
no one knows
what is happening
exactly
it's the reverend
the grave of the reverend
that's all i can
what reverend
it was on the tombstone
but who's the reverend
exactly
what you mean, the fucking reverend in the town, man
she was opening his grave up for no reason
oh, yeah, all right
oh, she got chocolate syrup all over her
the next morning
this is a piece of shit
I can answer these questions real quickly
seriously
please, please because I'm running out of gas over here
guess over the the the Native Americans
were mad go on because of atrocities
probably and and it was their burial
ground uh-huh
so the magic in the ground caused all
these things to happen stop-motion
creatures the it was a grave of the
Reverend to come back to life all these
things I think at some point I could be
wrong but I remember hearing from the
the wacky mayor it was featured on the
back of the box around yeah I want to
say that there was a cabin in the woods
esque plot yes where he said something
like I gotta keep the generations my two
forefathers were we keep no abuse you're
saying is saying it wrong something is
happening up on that mountain I'm
telling you for the last time to close
this lodge your guests are in danger no
jurisdiction here every couple of years
I've gotta get a person up onto this
mountain and I've gotta kill them it's
not a big deal and then I put on my
clown man you might do a little twirl
it's literal
where what movie were you watching I
don't know check though this is okay
we're all gonna put on our clown masks
oh you've been listening to the local
creeps old Indian tales wouldn't mean it
bullshitting you you saw the would you
be
anyway I should say it's not it's not
he's not the best because it's not he's
cool is not because it's the effeminate
like think that that's not what me like
because that could have easily have just
been like insulting and kind of like
character it was that he had owes him
yes that was him it was the only person
in the whole movie that brought any kind
of like character charisma or or
anything to the role everyone just to
the woods and look at the thing I have
mustache on my face Richard doing too
much emotion oh yeah quit him moaning so
my god I got I got a good like more
static - it's funny you mention that
though because I actually do have a
friend from quite a few years ago who's
moved up here I've been meaning to look
him up just haven't had the chance was
tracking problems I'm shocked that he
wasn't in morph and morph is very
disappointing I would have liked he was
in we looked him up or whatever reason
he hasn't noticed I'm standing there
watching him play right and like a
certain point you're George like rolling
the dice by not leaving as soon as you
see the bad dancing petting corpses that
was actually the most chilling part
it was the most cinematic part of the
entire was a look at the movie is not a
movie even that no it's like you go oh
this is like a really weird like creepy
scene and then a character walks in and
it's supposed to be a moment where he
like he was like this guy's be like
really weird but instead he's just
standing in the doorway watching this
guy and then he doesn't move or do
anything it goes on for like a really
long time and he's holding a hand he's
holding a head because he had found the
head and was trying to sneak back out of
the lodge he never found it the Denny
well you never she's found it found it
though this is carrying it
no that was that genic why did he do
that with the doors open there's
multiple sake yeah it wasn't but also he
didn't even unlock it he just broke the
window and then to open the door like
work your windows why is he holding a
head oh why is anything anything
why winter beasts I know who saw this
film a long time ago Justin Timberlake
and Andy Sandberg because there is a
dick in the box and that's where they
got the idea let's talk about that let's
talk about the dick in the box
where'd this come from is this supposed
to be a dick
so the box just happened to be in the
box cuz the important thing in the box
next to the dick he's like there's this
box and it has this one sacred artifact
and he opens the box and there's two things
clearly a dick
it was a clear dick and there's other stuff
and then he goes like reaches in and you're like oh he's gonna pick that dick up right now and talk about it
and he goes, anyway this tooth is very important
he's like, this is my father's, like he's saving this for a while
and you see his hand go past the dick, and go towards the thing that you can't see
yep
it could just be the tooth from any large animal, or
no, what about the giant dick that's next to it
wait a second
oh, yeah
that's the unrelated
you cared about that tooth
this is my father's dick
but the only person who knows is gonna be
yeah what is she doing here she's like
at the table but she she was just there
sitting there
who sees a waitress on break oh you're
giving my [ __ ] work you don't tell me
where to go
holy show me the [ __ ] movie man you
might have a film at your table for a
movie she's gotta get one shot what my
one critique of the film did your woman
curtain my one critique of the film is
that I couldn't hear or understand
anything that was happening I thought it
was a fantastic everyone problem was
that I didn't realize I didn't realize
at the end that they were fighting a
giant
it's like somebody spliced together
footage from like eight different movies
that were only like 15 percent complete
but it's literally it's so hard to tell
geography of anything because like oh no
it's winter again wait what show me any
different completely different outfit so
my god oh oh it took all of us are
really long time to be like we're
shooting a giant horse perspective yes
perspective she was a bad the dick
necklace a [ __ ] miracle collagen
thing yeah I think he's that still yeah
that is still that's why he's moving
like that yeah it still let you know his
arms look bigger are longer
getting through this is one of the most
difficult things I've ever had my
favorite character shades yeah um he's
talking with which ginger stash yeah and
then all of a sudden good company look
walks right in for it just like just
walks eclipses him with the camera and
just stands there he's just like he's
weights for like stash to walk up to him
they talk and then he like done company
leaves and shades is still there who
talk about just how oddly that entire
[ __ ] shot is framed we have three
characters talking to each other and the
shot is frames that all three characters
are on the far right fifth of the screen
standing in a row standing stacked in
front of one another
rich it's the rule of thirds yeah
one-third your character is overlapping
each other's three thirds a plant there
is a weird thing in this movie where it
seemed like a lot of the sets were like
half of a wall and so both actors are
like there's that one scene where the
guy in the girl are talking and he's
like he's like this close to a little
bit one I just all over crotchal area I
hope nobody saw it
Jay can you edit that out
could you could you just don't do that
in slow motion and zoom it in as the
beer drips right down my pants it's
uploading in the stories I've heard
about Cory mountain around
as long as I can remember stories what
are you talking about why are they so
close to each other yeah they're
actually just staring at her he's making
these what is it my turn to talk the
background changes yes yeah that was one
of like the two times in the movie they
didn't like shot reverse shot for a
discussion and every time they did it I
could feel the director photography's
pain he like didn't like doing that that
movie that movie used coverage more
sparingly than I've ever seen a movie
it's static two shots you get your
master and that's it I mean I think that
was why we actually wanted to turn this
off in like the first 15 minutes really
it makes it will just look like
masterful filmmaker
oh yeah which is also mostly just two
shots not like closest new one I like
yeah look I mean just even the inserts
like we're kind of just you can see that
they were done later to kind of like so
they can kind of cut between take one
and take two because there was
definitely not take three done on this
movie yep at all hole under the
circumstances I don't think you have any
choice shut down your lives and the
trails and then that way we can conduct
in a safe extensive search of the area
without any more like yeah good enough
there we go all right one take surgeon
gingers - there's a one scene when the
power goes out and it's like the most
basic thing ever they just they just
jump cut from lit scene to blue and they
could have just shown like filmed a
light bulb just turning off well I'm
done that's that's a break whoa whoa
slow down cowboy
slow down orson welles what are you
doing good fancy mr. Hollywood
the light ball misses Santino tell me
more shoot your movie with cameras or
whatever all lights and things oh Jesus
Christ look at what do you know I got so
many ideas look at how we do that you
and your fancy ideas as we put the
camera down and it stays there goddamn
this is not how we do in the berkshires
all right get the [ __ ] outta here
[ __ ]
microphone microphone oh I'm from LA I'm
gonna make the phone there's no wing
apiece light the shots sure go Sykes
like I'm some kind of God can just snap
lights on and off or something the sun's
gonna rise out my ass now get over it to
that field and let's finish shooting
this movie yeah it's what your kids have
for years
listen like we do in Massachusetts I
have to filter out 70% static before
they can hear what somebody's saying in
our movies rich do you hate all those
scummy people from the East Coast
scumbags it's just a bunch of scumbags
oh yeah what happened to the chicken
monster yep wait the chicken toaster go
they defeated him when they defeated the
totem they did when they knocked that
totem down and killed all them yeah what
movie were you watching I don't know no
I'm just gonna say just wait just win a
way they thought we'd forget you missed
the 21 other movies that came before
winter beasts then sort of set up out
all the events of September B's
you better start paying attention to
these films or you're off this show yes
Wow got it continue at ease yeah fine
I'm gon [ __ ] you oh thank god do we all
move down one or how does this work now
oh yeah oh yes yes I'm rich Evans and
I'll tell you all about roar the rover
is a movie about a guy and his family
and he wants to reunite with his family
in Africa the main thing is that his
house is infested with lions the
pradhans movie is extremely simple is
that he is going to go pick up his
family from the airport but his family
already made it to the house and oh [ __ ]
Lant lions are at the house
their fault for opening the door ahead I
don't want to make it seem like the
Lions randomly appear once the family
gets there no no no the Lions are there
and the protagonist is there and he's
worried about his family getting there
and discovering that the Lions are there
before he gets there
which they do wait no don't break the
eggs no [ __ ] you first you said not to
hello it's me from the other families
correct you it's also not just lions

giraffes leopards feathers Jaguars
Cougars but the best cougar in the whole
movie was Tippi Hedren
real lions tigers Alleluia oh yeah
giraffe I mean they not trained also not
trained yes these are real animals that
have director and writer credits because
they're completely improvising of course
they are take over the provide I'm sure
the because someone got [ __ ] cute
let's be honest I'm just gonna say like
they got through the couple first couple
of classes at Second City and they're
like we get it yeah yeah we're really
good at improv yeah yeah the TGA and the
WJ had nothing to do with us the MGM did
so try to know about DGA rules on that
zebras like well the lines are in the
writing credit yeah tell that line I
didn't write the movie and the actors
are trying to get across the the barest
of plot thinnest barely anything but
there are the backstory is is a hundred
and fifty million times more interesting
than the real story absolutely and
you're saying no marshal yes a crazy
will ferrell looking guy it's too large
ethic in real life he loves lions yes he
has a lot in his wife he and Tippi
Hedren Tippi Hedren was famous from the
birds so he took a dream and no Marshall
Norman officer was a producer he
produced the exorcists and they made a
ton of money and had a nature preserve
specifically for large cats California
well actually California what happens
was they started reading the lines on
their property
yeah like Beverly Hills yeah and then
like the sheriff was like no cut that
[ __ ] out okay so you should not have
Lions in [ __ ] Beverly Hills so they
started boarding them at a you know look
at like you know reserve or whatever and
then they realized they were paying more
for the animals and they could afford
the mortgage so they bought the Nature
Reserve and they sold their house in
Beverly Hills bought some boats and
trailers and then moved to the Nature
Reserve so they could make this movie
put aside the fact that this was a
nerve-wracking experience I don't like
to watch people get hurt I was just
worried the whole time even though I
knew no one died I was still like I like
I didn't like it but put that aside it
felt like it felt like what it was which
was like some rich dude who's like I'm
gonna buy lions because I love lions now
and then he like has a bunch of [ __ ]
lions and he's like I'm gonna make a
movie with the Lions and then there was
like no script and no [ __ ] ideas and
then let's say the movie meanders all
over the place where it's like they
introduce you like this guy and his
lions and you're like oh that's cool and
then it's like 25 minutes of just like
the Lions jumping on him Tommy Jimmy
the grizzly bears Lions even supposed to
be tea no no no that's what the guy in
the bill was going about oh yeah don't
ya know this is the I know it's gonna
happen here
meanwhile the plots just hanging out
here the plushies chillin we're back to
it in a nutshell it's it's very similar
to Hawk Jones I what I was saying in a
nutshell
were similar to Hawk Jones okay in the
fact where it doesn't go one way or the
other
roar like there's two messages it's like
oh that the the crazy guy
Nowell marshall is like lions are
wonderful creatures they're just little
cuddly wonderful yeah that it's horror
movie because family shows up at the
house and oh my [ __ ] god there's
lions and there's a horror sequence that
Lassiter at the forty minutes yeah where
they're all hiding like lockers and
office trying to maul them and their
logins over them and it's like okay
that's a good horror movie promise so
for this shot will just let the line
[ __ ] nuts inside
and action that's the one I like how the
lines won't start till he says action
yeah he says cut and they all just leave
coffee
god bless this crew I swear to God that
camera department we know 70 of them
that were mauled and gender bought like
lost half of his [ __ ] skull I don't
even know yeah he has scalp from a nape
to to hairline yeah well any Griffith
had both sides of her face worse worse
important hug the other night I think
like the first act wasn't really set up
properly the first act was supposed to
be Oh like you know they're dangerous
lions but at the same time they're kind
of cute and cuddly
yeah the teenage girls they roughhouse
with each other yeah it's like that but
at the same time like they can
cohabitate with human right and he gives
a little spiel to those little hunter
guys right little hunter guys you know
they were like normal-sized hunters hog
Jones and McCallister show up and
they're like but but the things they're
trying to establish it oh look you know
they look vicious the way that they play
but at the same time look know they're
docile they're like house cats kind of
thing
I think the idea is that when the family
shows up yep is that they automatically
assume that their Dean's we're gonna
move he spent so much time you're right
because the movie so much time that
first act yes showing the lot you know
he would be like giving dialog and in
line would jump out of nowhere and like
tackle him to the ground it wasn't fun
and because the audience wasn't in on
like oh I guess this guy's saved cuz no
one feels safe at any point the whole
movie just kept thinking of that one
scene from gladiator another one you
know they have the Lions got like yeah
it kind of goes like this it's clearly
like look digitally altered and just
kind of swipes at Russell Crowe for like
two seconds yeah oh that's what do you
like so do you like the better if they
just suck some Lions on Russell Crowe
150 of them just climbing out the sword
chopper SiC balls underscore the amount
of lions like I think I don't know that
I even want to it's like a [ __ ]
zombie movie
that's pretty bad done that was a dummy
know who's really Tippi Hedren I
wouldn't be shocked they're like no it's
too dangerous to put you in this barrel
now go stand with 50 lions
we need a stunt double for the Barrow
gang no you could get hurt watching the
trailer even you're like oh yeah there's
like you know lions there no no no like
they'll open the door at one point and
it's just like lions minds of Mines and
lions in life there's a bit of a strange
like like psychological effect to like I
think also for the actors involved
because okay you're you're you're in a
situation there's one lion right by it's
just worthless kind of yeah but when
there's like hundreds of them it's like
something is switched on in your brain
where it's like oh they're just like a
bunch of dogs or something say something
you like get the danger like you have a
Siegfried and Roy they worked with their
white tigers for like 25 years
everything's fine it's like the [ __ ]
it's a glutton time it's that's it it's
like the bumper hounds or whatever it is
from the Christmas story except with you
know five hundred pound line yes yes
come knock over the Christmas table and
eat the turkey the turkey is your
daughter and your son and your son they
were flirting with disaster on such a
level it's amazing where it's like they
probably all became accustomed at the
end were they're like cuddling and
tickling any moment
snap lion trips their face off the
family is like crawls across this water
bridge and do this other shed or like
I'll be safe here we just need to sleep
Oh God we're so [ __ ] tired and they
all crawl in there I'm going to sleep
and then some Lions just come over and
also go to sleep with them because no
you said some Lions yeah it's like all
of the Lions
I'm gonna smother you to death she was
crushed it's like if you're trying to
make Nightmare on Elm Street and the
premise was Freddy Krueger is your
friend yes and like that's what I'm
trying to go for your dream and he's
just running around but he loves you
it's because he looks scary that you're
afraid of him yeah really just there to
just play along and scrape is causing
that's that's the point that's the
equivalent of raw Freddy Krueger is your
friend we're not scared anymore for no
reason
we discovered that they sleep sometimes
don't be afraid of dangerous wild
animals like worst of the three movies
you've hushed
this is the worst this is amazing the
lines are never gettin personalities so
you don't ever think that you don't ever
feel like there's a narrative to the
Lions behavior so all of that other
stuff falls apart cuz you're like no
they're lions sometimes they're gonna be
hungry sometimes they're gonna be
thirsty and then if they see you they
might try to eat you yeah they sure
maybe they're giving you a hug or they
get tired of hugging you and they decide
to also or they might they might just
eat a zebra in your living room and
short and short of that and you're lucky
your shoes but I get what you're saying
and that is for the most part sure we've
got toe gar and Turner is like these
antagonists right though they just
poured blood on a lion he never does
that's what I mean fake blood is on the
line at no point does that line behave
any differently is he any worse than the
other line is yeah what is it what is
you the the the bad hunters that are
shooting although he texts them so some
of the other
No hold on the antagonist of the film
they're the goddamn [ __ ] here they're
going well what you guys are doing is
totally dangerous uh-huh
what are you trying to prove that you
can have lying socializing these people
we got troubled the villain of the film
is no marshal yes yes because he created
this situation I liked that the Tigers
kept jumping on anytime there was a boat
that Tigers kept trying to climb into
the boat and then the bait would tip
over no that's only half a ton in the
front of your boat yeah yeah oh sorry
sorry I think if I just pull it down if
there's anything that I can impart to
you about that what I learned from roar
is that Tigers love boats
elephants hate boats that part was cool
too and that elephant like rock that
boat up for no reason my bow I'm taking
it
the sign said even the Lions [ __ ]
it was the rage I've never seen it an
elephant like after he's like destroyed
it there's at one shot where he
literally kicks it he's like [ __ ] just
boom
I've never seen an elephant look angry
like that Oh what happened you could
tell by the length of the tusks that was
a juvenile so that was like yeah he was
he was listening to like Rage Against
the Machine he was angsty well yeah in
addition to the horror of lions and
tigers and Panthers Jaguars Levenson
every other thing yeah on the earth the
docile gentle giant elephant also just
destroys their boat a function abouts
get out of our [ __ ] plan
just start shooting everything it's got
to pee and does and breaks her leg your
life what yes so in that scene you can
see her what she broke he wraps his a
trunk around her leg and he and it the
trunk squeezed her legs so much that it
snapped
yes while they were shooting that yep
but so other other thing being if
terrible things happen to me movie put
them in there of course I took a xanax
before watching did you I took it didn't
really grab this is having your [ __ ]
scalp ripped off by a lion she's a
pretty girl you know like a nice-looking
human being and you go oh and then she
was barred and I thought the set of roar
was dangerous well everyone it's yes
it's that magical time of the night when
we pick our best of the worst and well
yeah III really I would I would say
without a doubt it's war but I'm not
sure rich I know you're gonna pick roar
is irresponsible
it is criminally negligent and it is the
most amazing [ __ ] thing I've ever
seen it's it's war all the way I was
looking forward to it and like I knew a
lot about it and it freakin delivered
it's the amazing contrast that the
amazing contrast in roar is what the
filmmakers want you to feel contrast
with what you're actually feeling my god
don't kill his children rich guy ask you
this though roar utterly failed in its
intentions
sure yes but it doesn't mean it's not
amazing to watch every like every movie
we watch the best of the worst fails in
its intentions some of this was
enthralling I don't know Jones failed in
its intentions you keep you keep Hawk
Jones I'm gonna take her home I'll watch
war again my pick is winter peace roar
yeah I'm picking roar it's it's it's
it's so unique war war or winter beast
here's the thing the best of the worst
right the best of the worst like winter
beasts really no don't try to change his
mind
this made him anxious well know roar was
the most effective in and I had the most
fun during winter beast because I wasn't
anxious because and when he does making
fun of how stupid was this measure that
guy
it's a lot of credit for a performance I
love the Groot thing I like every time
they turn the thing every time like a
monster would grab a human and they
would cut to a claymation human in the
monsters hand getting thrown across the
room there was there's some fun stuff we
laughed a lot we love books incredible
also and where is the movie you will
talk about or think about yes and and
tell people and cry about a dreaming and
had nightmares about way from watch this
[ __ ] up movie and Macaulay Culkin made
me do it for work and it's a word I told
him I didn't want to and he was like you
have to or I'll fire you and when you
run into Melanie Griffith you say
wonderful job on your face never know
you got mauled by [ __ ] lion I think
though we'll end on the note with if you
haven't seen roar you need to see roar
but watch it with a group of friends and
family mm-hmm there's nothing like it
there's literally nothing will ever be
like roar ever again yeah no no it
should be like you know don't do this
don't do this your kids it is a hundred
percent a completely you I was a kid on
camera
don't sick Lions in your kid I'm just
saying
it's cool that Melanie Griffith kids
would be like yeah when I was a kid I
got attacked by multiple lions on when I
was a kid I was rich and rich you know I
was fake
killed by bees once looks like [ __ ] this
